EiffelStudio naturally includes a powerful Eiffel compiler, which is at the core of the IDE. It supports the entire Eiffel programming language as defined in the third edition of ''Eiffel: The Language''.

This compiler uses Eiffel's Melting Ice Technology (TM), which accounts for lightning-fast incremental recompilations, ideal during the development cycle. It also provides finalization, which yields a high level of optimization that should be used for released programs.
