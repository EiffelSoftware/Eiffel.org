It is possible to have a command executed before/after an eiffel compilation.
Tasks have these properties: 
* Command: command to execute
* Description: an optional description about the external
* Working directory: an optional working directory, if nothing is specified, the path to the configuration file will be used
* Must succeed: does the task have to finish successful for the compilation to continue?
* Condition: allows the same configuration with tasks to work in different situations (e.g. windows and unix) (see [[General Target Options|conditions]] )
