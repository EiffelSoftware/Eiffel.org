The new feature dialog window lets you create simple Eiffel features using the coding standards described in [[Object-Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition]]. It automates the task of writing set-procedures for attributes and it makes it easy for you to find the right feature clause for a new feature. The new feature dialog can be invoked whenever you have a class open in a development window. It is also used by the diagram tool when creating a client-supplier link.

==Use it when...==
* You want to be introduced to the style rules for Eiffel code as described in [[Object-Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition]], chapter 26.5 (page 891). 
* You want to create an attribute and you also want an invariant and/or a set-procedure generated for it.
* You want to add a feature in a feature clause that is not in your class yet, and you do not remember the feature clause order, or you want to add it in a feature clause that is in your class, but you cannot find it.

==Do not use it when...==
* You want to edit an existing feature. This is not possible, you can only create new features with it.
* You want to write a more advanced feature. With the feature wizard, you can enter only a single line of code.
