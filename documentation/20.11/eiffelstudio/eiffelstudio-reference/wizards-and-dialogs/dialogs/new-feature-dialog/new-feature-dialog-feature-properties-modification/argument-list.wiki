For functions and procedures, you can build a formal argument list. You can do this by clicking on the '''New argument''' button as many times as you need arguments. 

{{note|Even though this dialog always shows parentheses, if the list is empty, empty parentheses will not generated. In other words, the dialog will generate the correct Eiffel syntax. }}


<div>  [[Image:feature-wizard-3-arguments]]  </div><br/>
{{note|If you add arguments to a routine, it is not possible anymore to select routine type '''once'''. }}


For every attribute you selected, enter a name in the text box and a type using the [[Type selection|type selection]] .
