To change the status of one breakpoint, it is possible to use the [[Breakpoint editing|breakpoints menu]] , which changes the state of a single breakpoint at a time. 

To change the status of several breakpoints at the same time, the easiest way is to use the [[Breakpoint commands|breakpoints-related commands]] , which have actions at feature-scope, class-scope and system-scope.
