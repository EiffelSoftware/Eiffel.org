==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\wel\fontenum\''. 
* Choose ''fontenum.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. If you select another directory than the default one, please copy icons (*.ico) and resource files (*.rc) from the default directory (the one containing the ecf file) to the new one.
* Click '''OK'''.

==Under the Hood==

<code>MAIN_DIALOG</code> inherits from [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_main_dialog_chart|WEL_MAIN_DIALOG]]  and also WEL_FONT_FAMILY_ENUMERATOR. <code>MAIN_DIALOG</code> implements action which was deferred from WEL_FONT_ENUMERATOR and executed every an enumeration finds a new font. This new implementation is used to display the available fonts in the [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_list_view_chart|WEL_LIST_VIEW]] 

This sample contains the following classes: 
* <code>APPLICATION_IDS</code>
* <code>FONTENUM_DEMO</code>
* <code>MAIN_DIALOG</code>
