==Compiling==

To compile the example:   
# Launch EiffelStudio.
# Click '''Add project'''
# Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\dotnet\winforms\hello_world\''
# Choose ''hello_world.ecf''
# Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file.
# Click '''Open'''.


==Running==

After launching the application, you will see a window displayed with a similar appearance to the one above. This is the simplest windows form we can display. We have just set the title with "HelloWorld". 



==Under the Hood==

The application shows how to display a Windows Form under the windows environment. The application inherits the <span><eiffel>FORM</eiffel></span> class, and just set the title with <span><code>"Hello world"</code></span> with the inherited feature <span><eiffel>set_text</eiffel></span>. 
<code>
            set_text ("Hello world")
</code>

The application is launched in a <eiffel>PROCESS</eiffel> with this command line:
<code>
            {WINFORMS_APPLICATION}.run_form (Current).
</code>

This sample uses the following classes:
*  <span><eiffel>FORM</eiffel></span> 
* <eiffel>WINFORMS_APPLICATION</eiffel>

==Notes==

This sample is translated from the example located in the QuickStart\winforms\samples\simple hello world subdirectory of the.NET Framework SDK samples directory of Microsoft Visual Studio.NET.
