The generated Eiffel code reflects the architecture of the component described in the definition file. Each interface corresponds to a deferred Eiffel class that includes one deferred feature per interface function. The deferred features are implemented in heirs of the interface class. Classes inheriting from these interfaces implement either a coclass or an implemented interface (that is an interface whose instance might be used as an argument on one of the component interfaces functions). 


==Projects Accessing Existing COM Components==

In a project accessing an existing component, the Eiffel classes corresponding to component coclasses inherit from the class [[ref:libraries/com/reference/ecom_queriable_chart| <eiffel>ECOM_QUERIABLE</eiffel> ]] , which is part of the EiffelCOM library. This class includes the feature <eiffel>make_from_other</eiffel> which allows initializing the component from another instance of [[ref:libraries/com/reference/ecom_interface_chart| <eiffel>ECOM_INTERFACE</eiffel> ]] .

==Projects Implementing New COM Components==

In a project implementing a new component, the Eiffel classes corresponding to component coclasses inherit from the class [[ref:libraries/com/reference/ecom_stub_chart|<eiffel>ECOM_STUB</eiffel>]], which is part of the EiffelCOM library. This class includes the feature [[ref:libraries/com/reference/ecom_stub_chart|<eiffel>create_item</eiffel>]] which allows initializing the component.

The '''Interface_proxy''' folder includes Eiffel classes wrapping interfaces that may be returned by functions on other interfaces. These classes inherit from both the deferred interface class located in '''Common\Interfaces''' and [[ref:libraries/com/reference/ecom_queriable_chart| <eiffel>ECOM_QUERIABLE</eiffel> ]] . 

[[Image:implemented-interface]]  


The '''Interface_stub''' folder includes Eiffel classes implementing interfaces that may be given to the component as an argument. These classes inherit from both the deferred interface class and [[ref:libraries/com/reference/ecom_stub_chart| <eiffel>ECOM_STUB</eiffel> ]] .
