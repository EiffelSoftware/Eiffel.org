A primitive is an EiffelVision 2 widget that may not contain other widgets. Primitives may be placed in [[Containers|containers]], but a primitive [[Widgets|widget ]] may not contain any child widgets. Some examples of primitives are [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_button_chart|EV_BUTTON]]  and [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_label_chart|EV_LABEL]]. All EiffelVision 2 primitives inherit from [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_primitive_chart|EV_PRIMITIVE]].


==Features of a Primitive==

All primitives inherit from [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_tooltipable_chart|EV_TOOLTIPABLE]]  and therefore may have tooltips assigned to them. They all inherit many features from [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_widget_chart|EV_WIDGET]]. Each descendent of [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_primitive_chart|EV_PRIMITIVE]]  will typically have many features specific to its type. For example, [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_separator_chart|EV_SEPARATOR]]  has no extra features, but [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_label_chart|EV_LABEL]]  has features for modifying the current font and text to be displayed. 


==Widgets as Item Holders==

Although no primitive can contain another widget, certain primitives may contain one or more [[Items|items]]. One example of this is an [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_list_chart| EV_LIST]]  containing [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_list_item_chart|EV_LIST_ITEM]]s.
