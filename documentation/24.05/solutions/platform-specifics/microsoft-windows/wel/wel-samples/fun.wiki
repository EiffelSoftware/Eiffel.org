==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\wel\fun\''. 
* Choose ''fun.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Click '''OK'''. 

==Running==
After launching the program, a window will be displayed as illustrated above. Clicking the push button marked "Maze" will open a new window and draw a maze within this window. Clicking the push button marked "Artist" will open a new window, and display output dependent on the movement of the mouse pointer within the client area of that window. Clicking the push button marked "Fun" will open a new window which contains a fake error message and a close push button which moves when you try to move the mouse pointer over it. 
==Under the Hood==
Both <code>FUN_DIALOG</code> and <code>ARTIST</code> redefine <code>on_mouse_move</code> to track the actions of the mouse pointer and respond accordingly. 
This sample contains the following classes: 
* <code>APPLICATION_IDS</code>
* <code>ARTIST</code>
* <code>FUN_DEMO</code>
* <code>FUN_DIALOG</code>
* <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code>
* <code>MAZE</code>
