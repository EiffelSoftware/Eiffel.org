In the directory '''$ISE_EIFFEL/examples/lex''' you will find a system that scans Eiffel classes. It consists of the class [[EIFFEL_SCAN Text|EIFFEL_SCAN]] . It uses the file [[EiffelLex Samples|eiffel_regular]]  as lexical grammar to analyze an Eiffel class passed on the command line. 

When compiling the example, the executable '''eiffel_scan(.exe)''' is created. Use the program as follows: 
<code>eiffel_scan <Eiffel class file>;</code>

As an example, when the [[eiffel_scan console input|source code]]  of the root class is run through the scanner, it outputs a [[eiffel_scan console output|list]]  of all consecutive tokens and keywords in that class to the console.
