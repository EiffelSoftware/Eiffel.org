The support cluster contains many classes providing useful facilities within the library. Many of the classes within this cluster are constants classes, which are filled with constants values for specific contexts, generally indicated by their names. The following constants classes are available within this cluster: 

* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_character_format_constants_chart|EV_CHARACTER_FORMAT_CONSTANTS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_dialog_constants_chart|EV_DIALOG_CONSTANTS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_drawable_constants_chart|EV_DRAWABLE_CONSTANTS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_font_constants_chart|EV_FONT_CONSTANTS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_key_constants_chart|EV_KEY_CONSTANTS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_paragraph_constants_chart|EV_PARAGRAPH_CONSTANTS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_pointer_constants_chart|EV_POINTER_CONSTANTS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_pointer_style_constants_chart|EV_POINTER_STYLE_CONSTANTS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_postscript_page_constants_chart|EV_POSTSCRIPT_PAGE_CONSTANTS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_scroll_constants_chart|EV_SCROLL_CONSTANTS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_text_alignment_constants_chart|EV_TEXT_ALIGNMENT_CONSTANTS]] 


In a similar vein to constant classes, the following two classes are provided to provide support for default [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_color_chart|EV_COLOR]]s and [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_pixmap_chart|EV_PIXMAP]]s. 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_stock_colors_chart|EV_STOCK_COLORS]] 
* [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_stock_pixmaps_chart|EV_STOCK_PIXMAPS]]
