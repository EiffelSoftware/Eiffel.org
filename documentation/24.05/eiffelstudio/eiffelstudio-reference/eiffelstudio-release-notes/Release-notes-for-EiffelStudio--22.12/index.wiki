==Graphical environment==
* Added code completion support for once classes
* Improved the '''Add Library''' implementation by allowing to add "redirection" ecf files, and fixed the '''Add Cluster''' functionalities in recursive cluster.
* Fixed an harmless exception when first inserting Unicode symbol using the "Insert Symbol" dialog on Windows.

==Compiler==
* New platforms:  macosx-armv6 (M1, M2 support) and linux-arm64.
* Reviewed and updated generated C code to fix potential execution issues due to "clang" C compiler optimizations (especially on ARM architecture).
* Fixed the compilation of once class without any creation procedures.

==Tools==
* It is now possible to use the "emdc.exe" .Net md consumer, as an alternative to the COM md consumer from EiffelStudio, as a first step toward supporting .Net on non Windows platform.

== Warning ==
For Macos users on M1/M2 (arm) architecture, please read the specific note [[Release notes for EiffelStudio 22.12 - macosx]]
