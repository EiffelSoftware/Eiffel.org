The feature name field is a text box that lets you enter a name for the feature. For help on how to choose the right name for a feature, see: [[Object-Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition]], chapter 26, section 2. 


{{warning|EiffelStudio performs no validation on the name you choose. For example if you type a space in it, it will generate the code, and detect a syntax error only when compiling. }}
