It is possible to download the books of the Eiffel online documentation for viewing offline with a web browser. 

To do this you use a [http://docs.eiffel.com/static/ web page] which has links to downloadable files that contain copies of the documentation in different forms and quantities. 


[[Image:static documentation page|Downloadable documentation]]


The files are ".7z" files, meaning that they are compressed archives in [http://www.7-zip.org 7-zip] format. So, you can use any 7-zip compatible expander to unpack the files. 

You'll notice that the options for downloading come in three groups:

# HTML: Multiple pages per book.
# HTML: One big page per book.
# WikiText+meta: raw files containing wikitext (backup)

You should choose your files from one of the HTML options (the WikiText option is used for backup). 

It is possible also to download one documentation "book" at a time, or to download all books in one archive.

The files are static copies of the content of the online documentation, as reflected by the dates shown on the web page.
