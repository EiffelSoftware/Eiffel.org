The '''assignees''' view [[Image:feature-assignees-icon]] lists all features which appear in the current feature as targets of assignments. 

As with [[Feature formatters: Assigners|assigners]], this includes true assignments to class features only, that is, it does not include "targets" of the assignment-like syntax of '''assignment commands'''.
