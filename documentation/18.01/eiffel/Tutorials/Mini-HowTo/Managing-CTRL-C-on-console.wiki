[[Property:title|Managing CTRL+C on console]]
[[Property:link_title|CTRL_C terminal]]
Normally, if the user use the CTRL+C keys, the Eiffel application detect it as an error and throw an exception of type  {OPERATING_SYSTEM_SIGNAL_FAILURE}. To manage the CTRL+C keys, you can use a "rescue" clause to detect the exception and a "retry" mecanism to cancel the exception handeling done by the Eiffel runtime.
