The '''EiffelCOM Wizard''' is delivered with EiffelStudio, but it is a '''standalone tool''' (i. e., not part of the EiffelStudio IDE). You can find the wizard by following the directory path: <code lang="text">$ISE_EIFFEL\wizards\com</code>. The executable file <code lang="text">com_wizard_launcher.exe</code> will launch the GUI version of the wizard. The executable file <code lang="text">com_wizard.exe</code> is a command line version of the wizard described [[Wizards: Command Line Options|here]].

The EiffelCOM Wizard facilitates the creation of Eiffel projects implementing or reusing COM components.
