EiffelStore's main classes are grouped into 2 main layers: 
* The [[EiffelStore Interface Layer|interface layer]] provides a high-level, unique interface for every DBMS. 
* The [[EiffelStore Implementation Layer|implementation layer]] customizes high-level routines to various DBMS handles. 

Other clusters can facilitate your database management: 
* The [[EiffelStore Generation Cluster|generation cluster]], with the EiffelStore wizard, generates a facilitated and dynamic interface to your database. 
* The [[EiffelStore DataView Cluster|dataview cluster]] lets you create a customized database GUI.
