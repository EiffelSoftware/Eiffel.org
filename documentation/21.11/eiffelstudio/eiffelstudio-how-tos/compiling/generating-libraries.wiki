There are two main types of libraries in Eiffel: precompiled Eiffel libraries and C libraries. Both kinds of libraries can be created via EiffelStudio. The former can only be used in Eiffel projects, C libraries can be used either in Eiffel programs, or in standard C programs.

To generate an Eiffel precompiled library:
* Select the '''Precompilation Wizard''' in the '''Tools''' menu and follow the instructions, 

or
* Launch a new EiffelStudio session,
* Select your project
* Change the action to '''Precompile''', 
* Click '''Open''' 

To generate a dynamically linked C library using Eiffel code:
* Generate a definition file for this library, via the [[Dynamic library builder|Dynamic library Builder]] , 
* Open the [[Advanced Options|Project Settings]]  dialog, 
* In the '''Advanced''' section, set the '''Shared Library Definition''', 
* Enter the name of the definition you created in the first step(including the path if necessary),
* Compile the current project.

The generated C library should be located in the EIFGENs|target_name|W_code directory in the directory of your project.

To generate a C library from a C compiler, please refer to the documentation of your C compiler.
