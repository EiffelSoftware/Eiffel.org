There are several ways to open a new window. First, you can use the pick and drop shortcut. Then, you can use new window menu items and the corresponding icons. There are three such commands: 
* Clicking on '''New window''' in the '''File''' menu or on  [[Image:new-window-icon]]  make an new window appear. In this window, the editor and the context tool will be visible. 
* Clicking on '''New editor window''' in the '''File''' menu or on  [[Image:new-editor-icon]]  does the same as the previous command but the context tool is minimized in the new window. 
* Clicking on '''New context window''' in the '''File''' menu make this time a new window with a minimized editor appear. 


{{note|Icons mentioned above are droppable: instead of simply clicking on them, you can drop a stone on them. The tools in the new window will then be centered on the corresponding component.}}
