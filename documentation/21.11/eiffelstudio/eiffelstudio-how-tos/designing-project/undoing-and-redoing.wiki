Almost all actions in the diagram tool are undoable. Every action that can be undone, can also be redone. For advanced undoing, open the history tool.

{{tip|Undo actions cannot be undone. Use redo to undo an undo action. }}
* To undo the last action, click '''Undo last action'''.  [[Image:general-undo-icon]]  
* To redo the last action, click '''Redo last action'''.  [[Image:general-redo-icon]]  
* To undo all actions up until a specific action: 
*# Click the '''History tool''' button.  [[Image:general-undo-history-icon]]  
*# The '''History tool''' dialog appears with a list of all undoable actions. By clicking on one of the actions, the diagram returns to the state it was in just after you performed this action.
