==Graphical environment==
* On non Windows platforms (linux, macosx, ...), EiffelStudio is now using '''GTK3''' (instead of the older GTK2).
* The new '''Source Control''' tool provides basic '''GIT''' and '''subversion''' operations (status, diff, commit, ...). The related tools have to be installed on your machine, as the Source Control tool relies on the executable `git` and `svn` commands.

==Compiler==

==Libraries==
* The vision2 library is now using GTK3 by default on non Windows platforms (linux, macosx, ...). To compile using GTK2, set the variable `vision_implementation=gtk2`.
* The JSON library was improved with a new date time serializer, and the possibility to use the reflector serializer with JSON_BASIC_SERIALIZATION.
* Various bug fixes and improvements on the EiffelWeb library, and the Eiffel CMS solution.

==Known issues==
=== EiffelStudio IDE===
