This sample shows how to retrieve and display information from a basic form on a web page.


{{note|This sample requires a web server supporting CGI in order to be run. Both the Internet Information Services web server from Microsoft and the GNU Apache server may be used. }}


==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\web\basic\''. 
* Choose ''web.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Click '''OK'''. 

==Installing==

You should copy the file ''web_demo.exe'' in the ''cgi_bin'' directory of your web server and the file ''sample.html'' in a directory on the web server. 

==Running==

To run the example, access the page ''sample.html'' that you copied on the web server with a web browser (typically <nowiki>''http://localhost/sample.html''</nowiki>). Fill in the text field with a username and click ''Submit''. You should see a page displaying the name you just entered. Although not earth-shattering, this sample shows the basis for building more complex forms processing in Eiffel. 

==Under the Hood==

This basic sample has just one class <eiffel>SAMPLE</eiffel> which inherits from <eiffel>CGI_INTERFACE. SAMPLE</eiffel> implements execute which retrieves the name entered in the form and creates a new <eiffel>HTML</eiffel> page with it. 



See the EiffelWeb class reference for the class interfaces.
