When you are executing an Eiffel application within EiffelStudio (i.e you are debugging it), you may want to detach the debugger from this application without killing the application. The "Detach Execution" command will address this need.


You can find it under menu <code>Execution->Detach Execution</code>, and you can also add it to the execution tool bar items.
