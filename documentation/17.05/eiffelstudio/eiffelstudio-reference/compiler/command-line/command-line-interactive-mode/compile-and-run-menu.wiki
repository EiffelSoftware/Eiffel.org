The most common compiling option is L (Melt): recompile the system, melting recent changes. The other compilation possibilities are F (Freeze) and Z (Finalize). After a Freeze you will need to C-compile the result using the W (W-compile) command; similarly, you can C-compile the result of a Finalize using C (F-compile).

{{caution|You cannot select a different project from within ec loop; also, you cannot select a different configuration file from within the command, although you may of course change the contents of the configuration file (for example by using an editor in an other window). }}

The R option (Run) runs the application. You will be prompted for the arguments if the application needs any.
