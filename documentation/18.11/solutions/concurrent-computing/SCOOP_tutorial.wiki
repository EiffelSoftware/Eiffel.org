[[Property:link_title|SCOOP Tutorial (hands-on): a small concurrent email system]]

This tutorial comes with a full-fledged example: a simple email client system. It is hands-on, inviting you to look at the code of the sequential version of the system, then guiding you step-by-step to make it concurrent, and hence much nicer to use.

The Eiffel compiler helps you through out: at each step of the transformation from sequential to concurrent, the error messages tell you what remains to be done.

For reading convenience the tutorial is in PDF format. It includes all the links to the code to be downloaded. 

Read the tutorial by clicking [https://www.eiffel.org/files/uploads/scoop_tutorial_%281%29.pdf this link].

You should also note the [https://learning.acm.org/webinars/coop ACM webinar on SCOOP] which relies on this example to provide a general introduction to SCOOP.
