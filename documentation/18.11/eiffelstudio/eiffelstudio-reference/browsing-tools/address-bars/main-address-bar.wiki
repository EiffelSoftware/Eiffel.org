The main address bar is located in the top part of windows, between the two [[Main toolbars|main toolbars]]  (when they are displayed). 

[[Image:main-address-bar]]  

It has several components:
* '''History back and forth arrows'''  [[Image:view-previous-icon]]  and  [[Image:view-next-icon]]  
** These functions are also accessible from the menu path <code lang=text>View -> Go to</code>

* '''Current class and feature name fields''' 
** These fields display the names of the class and/or feature currently active in the editor pane.
** It is possible to type a class or feature name to center the editor on it. 
** Typing a class name that does not exist in the set of known classes pops up a dialog to create a class of that name.
** The "wildcard" characters '''*''' and '''?''' may be used in these fields.

* '''View icons''' [[Image:view-editor-icon]] ,  [[Image:view-clickable-icon]] ,  [[Image:view-flat-icon]] ,  [[Image:view-contracts-icon]]  and  [[Image:view-flat-contracts-icon]]  
** Click to change the view currently displayed in the editor.
** Drop a pebble to retarget the editor to a class or feature using the selected view.

* '''Viewpoints selector'''
** The Viewpoints selector can only be active if you have used [[Group Options#Renaming|renaming and/or prefixing]] in your project settings to specify alternate class names for some classes used by your project. Otherwise it is inactive. In a project with renaming and/or prefixing, the Viewpoints selector becomes active when both of the following are true:
*** The editor window is focused on a class that has been renamed or prefixed in project settings.
*** The class is being viewed in a formatted view, i.e., a view other than the '''Basic text view'''. 
** The Viewpoints selector allows you to select how you would like to view renamed or prefixed classes: 
*** As they really exist, i.e., as if you are their producer, or 
*** Using the alternative names that you have specified in your project settings.
