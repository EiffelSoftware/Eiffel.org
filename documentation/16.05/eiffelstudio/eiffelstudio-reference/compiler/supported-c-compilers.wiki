==Unix/Linux Users:==

EiffelStudio supports `gcc' on most platforms and the native`cc' compiler if it is an ANSI C compiler.



==Microsoft Windows Users==

EiffelStudio supports Microsoft and MinGW compilers on Microsoft Windows.

===Microsoft Visual C++ Users===

By default the installation program will set in the registry keys the ISE_C_COMPILER key to `msc'.

EiffelStudio supports only version 14.0 and higher of the Microsoft Visual C++ environment. This is available in Visual Studio 2005 or higher revision, or in version of the Windows SDK 6.1 or higher.

EiffelStudio will automatically detect the location of the C compiler.

===MinGW Users:===

By default the installation program will set in the registry keys the ISE_C_COMPILER key to `mingw'.

In versions as late as 6.6, there is a [[EiffelCOM Wizard Guided Tour|restriction]] that prevents the use of EiffelCOM with the MinGW compiler.

===Changing your C compiler on Windows===

You can do it in either of two different ways. 

You can manually edit the registry key HKLM\Software\ISE\Eiffel''nn'' and change the value of the ISE_C_COMPILER string key to either `msc' or `mingw' depending upon the effect you desire.

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable ISE_C_COMPILER to either `msc' or `mingw'.
