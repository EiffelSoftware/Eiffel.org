==Graphical environment==

===What's new===
* Added new contract editor tool to ease edition of contracts on routines and classes.
* Added Eiffel Information System which let you connect external documentation to your Eiffel code and vice versa.
* Added ability to avoid comment duplication by using the <code><Precursor></code> in your descendant comment to reuse the parent one which is shown in all our formatter tools..
* Added new light batch compiler `ecb'. It provides the same features as `ec' when using the batch mode. Currently projects compiled with `ec' are not compatible with those compiled with `ecb'. The main difference between the two is that `ec' is compiled with exception trace and multithreading support which could slow down the compiler by a factor of 20 to 40% depending on your platform.
* Added experimental unit testing tool.

===Improvements===
* Error list tool now supports multiple selection, for better copy to clipboard usage.
* Enhanced some errors to report better context information.
* Optimized adding of items to the Error List by circumventing an expensive search when adding single items.

===Changes===
* Error list items context now shows the full group name but after CLASS.feature because it is of lesser importance.
* Restructured layout of user files to support unification and user-override files of Eiffel compiler installation files. Relocated default Eiffel projects location into the user files folder (windows and mac only).

===Bug fixes===
* Fixed the EiffelCOM wizard so that it generates C code that compiles.

==Compiler==

==Debugger==
===Graphical environment===
* New breakpoint editor, which centralizes in a unique dialog the parameters of the breakpoint.
* Added tag support for breakpoints.
* Added new "When hits.." actions (such as enable/disable breakpoints, start/stop execution recording, and others...).
* Better breakpoints tool, to see, sort or filter the breakpoints
* Enhanced execution record and replay mechanism. This allows to record the execution, and replay the recording in EiffelStudio and see/browse the recorded values, and the calls executed.
* Better dialog to change the layout of the Objects tool grid. It is possible to easily change the order of 'Current, arguments, locals, ...'.
* Added a toggle button, to ignore or not the breakpoints.
* Added dropdown menu on the "[Start]" button to have quicker access to useful features.

===Debugger engine===
* Watch tool: added support for "create .." expression.

==EiffelBuild==
* Click [[EiffelBuild Version History|here]]  for the EiffelBuild release notes.

==Libraries==

===EiffelBase===
* Changed signature of {<eiffel>SPECIAL</eiffel>}.<eiffel>same_items</eiffel> and {<eiffel>SPECIAL</eiffel>}.<eiffel>all_default</eiffel> to take an extra argument. Our analysis shows that it was only used by <eiffel>ARRAY</eiffel> and that it should be harmless. If you have a compilation error, simply add `0' as first argument of your call.
* Changed <eiffel>physical_size</eiffel> in <eiffel>INTERNAL</eiffel> to return the real allocated size of an object along with its header size.
* Added <eiffel>deep_physical_size</eiffel> in <eiffel>INTERNAL</eiffel> to compute the size of an object and all its dependencies.
* Improved speed of <eiffel>read_stream</eiffel> in <eiffel>FILE</eiffel> so that it used underlying `fread' once rather than calling `getc' for each requested character. Our benchmarks show that you can save up to 2s for 1000 calls.
* Added an assigner routine for <eiffel>item</eiffel> in <eiffel>ARRAY2</eiffel>. This might break descendant classes of <eiffel>ARRAY2</eiffel> redefining <eiffel>item</eiffel>.
* Updated code toward Void-safety.

===EiffelNet===
* Fixed bug in {<eiffel>SOCKET</eiffel>}.<eiffel>read_stream</eiffel> where if there was a socket error, then it would cause a precondition violation in <eiffel>C_STRING</eiffel>.

===EiffelTime===
* Added support for <eiffel>DEBUG_OUTPUT</eiffel> for <eiffel>DATE</eiffel>, <eiffel>TIME</eiffel> and <eiffel>DATE_TIME</eiffel> objects making it easier to debug code based on them.
* Fixed bug where duration in days between two dates overlapping a leap year would yield a result off by +1 or -1.
* 10% speed improvement on certain date operations (can be seen on eweasel test#time002).

===EiffelVision2===
* [[Revisions and Bug Fixes|Click here for EiffelVision2 release notes.]] 

===EiffelVision2===
* Fixed a bug in {<eiffel>WEL_REGISTRY</eiffel>}.<eiffel>enumerate_key</eiffel> where the routine would go in an infinite loop if the key name was larger than 64 characters.
