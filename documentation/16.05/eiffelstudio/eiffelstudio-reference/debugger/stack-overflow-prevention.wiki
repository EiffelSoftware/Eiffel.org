Stack overflow prevention makes it possible to have the debugger detect stack overflow situations and warn you before they occur.

You can control this option through a dialog accessible via the menu path:

<code lang=text>
Execution --> Overflow prevention...</code>


The dialog lets you decide at which call stack depth a warning should be issued.

By default, a warning is issued when the debugged program reaches a stack depth of 1,000 elements.


{{note|Once an application has stopped at the selected level, it will not stop again until its stack depth goes below the critical stack depth again. }}
