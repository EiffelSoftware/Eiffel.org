While working on a project, you may want to launch your system with one or more arguments.

There are two ways to access the '''Execution Parameters''' dialog which lets you specify arguments to be used by your system when launched from EiffelStudio:
* By following the EiffelStudio menu path: <code lang="text">Execution -> Execution parameters</code> .
* By right-clicking any of the buttons on the debugging toolbar.

See the [[Execution profiles|Execution parameters dialog]] for more details.
