To move a class from a cluster to another one, you have to use the [[Diagram tool]]. First, [[Centering tools on a component|center the tool]]  on the cluster that contains the class you want to move. Then, if the destination cluster is not shown on the diagram, [[Pick-and-drop mechanism|pick]] it in the [[Groups tool|groups tool]] and drop it in the [[Diagram tool|diagram]]. Once both clusters are displayed, you just have to drag the class to its destination.
