# Start the '''Rename feature''' refactoring action by either:
## Selecting '''Refactor->Rename''' from the context menu associated with the feature you want to rename.
## Picking the feature and dropping its pebble into the '''Rename''' hole ([[Image:refactor-rename-icon]]) on the [[Main toolbars|refactoring toolbar]].
# After a compilation the '''Refactoring: Feature Rename''' dialog appears. You can enter a new name. 
# You can choose between these options: 
#*  '''Replace Name in Comments''': replace usage of the feature name in comments that follow the '''`featurename'''' syntax. 
#*  '''Replace Name in Strings''': replace usage of the feature name in strings that follow the '''`featurename'''' syntax. 
#*  '''Reuse existing name''': allow two or more features to have the same name during refactoring (note: the compiler will still report an error, if there are two or more features with same name, but this option could be use to merge two features). 
# Click '''OK'''.
