==Description==

Write a program that does the following in this order:
# Input an amount of time to sleep in whatever units are most natural for your language (milliseconds, seconds, ticks, etc.). This unit should be noted in comments or in a description.
# Print "Sleeping..."
# Sleep the main thread for the given amount of time.
# Print "Awake!"
# End.

==Notes==

The feature <code lang="eiffel">sleep</code> is defined in the library class <code>EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT</code>. So the demonstration class <code>APPLICATION</code> inherits from <code>EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT</code> in order to make <code lang="eiffel">sleep</code> available. 

<code lang="eiffel">sleep</code> takes an argument which declares the number of nanoseconds to suspend the thread's execution.

==Solution==

<code>
class
    APPLICATION
inherit
    EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT
create
    make
feature -- Initialization
    make
            -- Sleep for a given number of nanoseconds.
        do
            print ("Enter a number of nanoseconds: ")
            io.read_integer_64
            print ("Sleeping...%N")
            sleep (io.last_integer_64)
            print ("Awake!%N")
        end
end
</code>


==Output (sleeping 10 seconds)==

<code lang="text">
Enter a number of nanoseconds: 10000000000
Sleeping...
Awake!
</code>
