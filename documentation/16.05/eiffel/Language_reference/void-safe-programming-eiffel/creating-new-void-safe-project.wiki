Now that we've been introduced to the Eiffel void-safe facilities, let's look at what it takes to set up a new void-safe software project. Here we'll look at the void-safety related project settings and how the can be used. Then we'll look deeper into the use of some of the void-safe tools.

==Project settings for void-safe projects==

There are three project settings that are related to void-safety. These settings can be set with great granularity throughout your project to allow you maximum flexibility, particularly when including classes or libraries that are void-unsafe or that have been converted to void-safety, but must do double duty in the void-safe and void-unsafe worlds. 

===The ''"Void-safe"'' setting===

The '''Void-safe''' setting determines whether and how the Eiffel compiler checks your project against the void-safe related validity rules. 

This is the essential void-safe project setting. It can assume one of three values:
# '''No''': No checking against any of the void-safety validity rules. Attachment marks '''attached''' and '''detachable''' are simply ignored.
# '''Conformance''': The attachment marks are not ignored for type conformance checks (with respect to VJAR/VBAR and related validity rules).
# '''Initialization''': Validity rules are selectively checked. The initialization rule (VEVI) and the target rule (VUTA) are checked only for attached entities and attached call targets -- i.e., detachable cases are not checked. 
# '''Transitional''': It is an obsolete level which is for users who have already migrated their code to void-safety using an old version of the compiler which did not implement all the void-safety validity rules (especially with agent initialization).
# '''Complete''': Complete checking against all void-safety validity rules.

So, for a new void-safe project, you would want to set this option first to '''Conformance''', then '''Initialization'''' and finally to '''Complete'''. This will let you migrate your code progressively without much changes at each steps.

===The ''"Are types attached by default?"'' setting===

It is this setting that tells the compiler how to treat declarations which specify neither the <code>detachable</code> keyword nor the <code>attached</code> keyword, for example:
<code>
    x: T
</code>
A value of '''True''' will instruct the compiler to treat <code>x</code> as if it were declared:
<code>
    x: attached T
</code>
A value of '''False''', and <code>x</code> will be viewed as if it were:
<code>
    x: detachable T
</code>

In a new project, ideally all of your declarations would be of attached types. But of course there are some occasions, for various reasons, that you must or should use detachable types. 

So, for a new void-safe project, it is recommended that a value of '''True''' is used. 

{{Warning|As of EiffelStudio 14.05, this setting will always be True by default and future releases of EiffelStudio will not let you change this.}}


{{SeeAlso| [[Void-safety: Background, definition, and tools#Types as "attached" or "detachable"|Types as "attached" or "detachable"]].}}


===The ''"Full class checking"'' setting===

This setting instructs the compiler to recheck inherited features in descendant classes. This setting is True and cannot be changed for projects with some void-safety level enabled.


==Void-safe libraries==

As of EiffelStudio version 13.11, all libraries distributed with EiffelStudio are void-safe except the EiffelCOM library.

{{note|During a period of transition, there will be different Eiffel configuration files (.ecf's) for void-unsafe and void-safe projects (for example, base.ecf and base-safe.ecf). If you have set the '''Void-safe''' setting to check for void-safety, then when you add a library to your project in EiffelStudio, you will see only the void-safe configurations by default. After the transition period, it is expected that there will be only one version of each of the configuration files for each library. The single configuration files will serve both void-unsafe and void-safe projects. }}

===Using generic classes===

Void-safety affects generic classes. Fortunately, from the viewpoint of those writing clients to the generic classes in the EiffelBase library, not much has changed. Still, you should understand the interplay between void-safety and [[ET: Genericity and Arrays|genericity]].

Consider a generic class like <code>LIST [G]</code>. The formal generic parameter <code>G</code> represents an arbitrary type. In a generic derivation of <code>LIST [G]</code>, say <code>LIST [STRING]</code>, the formal generic type is replaced by an actual generic type, in this case <code>STRING</code>. 

Remember that unconstrained genericity, <code>LIST [G]</code>, for example, is really a case of [[ET: Inheritance#Constrained genericity|constrained genericity]] in which the generic parameter is constrained to <code>ANY</code>, that is, it could be written <code>LIST [G -> ANY]</code>.

With the advent of void-safe Eiffel, the unconstrained generic class name <code>LIST [G]</code> now equates to <code>LIST [G -> detachable ANY]</code>. Because any type, say <code>T</code>, (synonymous with <code>attached T</code> in void-safe Eiffel) conforms to <code>detachable T</code>, this change facilitates the production of generic classes, but has little effect on writers of clients to those classes.

This change works for all the generic classes in EiffelBase ... except for one: <code>ARRAY</code>.  Arrays are a special case because we often create arrays with a pre-allocated number of elements. In the case of expanded types, there's not a problem. For example, in this code
<code>
    my_array: ARRAY [INTEGER]
                ...
            create my_array.make (1, 100)
</code>
we create <code>my_array</code> with one hundred <code>INTEGER</code> elements. <code>INTEGER</code> is an expanded type, and each element is initialized by applying the default initialization rule for <code>INTEGER</code>, i.e, the integer representation of zero.

However, if <code>my_array</code> had been declared of a type with reference semantics, say <code>STRING</code> (meaning, of course, <code>attached STRING</code>, the default rule would not work well, because the default initialization for references types is <code>Void</code> which would not be allowed in an array of elements of any attached type.

The solution to this challenge is fairly simple. For arrays of elements of detachable or expanded types, there is no different behavior. When dealing with arrays of elements of attached types, we must be careful. 

Creating an array using <code>ARRAY</code>'s creation procedure <code>make</code> may still be safe in some cases. Specifically, <code>make</code> can be used with arrays of elements of attached types if the arguments have values such that an empty array will be created, that is, when
<code>
        min_index = max_index + 1
</code>

In all other situations involving arrays of elements of attached types, <code>make</code> may not be used to do the creation. Rather, you should use the creation procedure <code>make_filled</code> which takes three arguments. The first is an object of the type of the array, and the second and third are the minimum and maximum indexes, respectively. When the array is created, each of the elements will be initialized with a reference to the object of the first argument. 

So, a call using <code>make_filled</code> would look like this:
<code>
    my_array: ARRAY [STRING]
                ...
            create my_array.make_filled (" ", 1, 100)
</code>
Upon creation, each element of the array will reference the same object; an object of type <code>STRING</code> composed of one space character.


{{note|Full void-safety on arrays of attached types requires a change to class <code>ARRAY</code> which can break existing code. During a transitional period, this and similar changes are available for testing and use in an "experimental" version of EiffelStudio. This version of EiffelStudio can be invoked by using the "-experiment" option from the command line, or by selecting it on Microsoft Windows by following the '''Start''' menu path to EiffelStudio. You are encouraged to try to compile your libraries and systems using experimental mode in order to prepare for the time when these changes are made permanent.<br/><br/>As of version 6.6, the normal mode of EiffelStudio becomes what had been accessible in earlier versions as "experimental".}}


==Using the ''attribute'' keyword carefully==

The keyword <code>attribute</code> should be used with some care. You might be tempted to think that it would be convenient or add an extra element of safety to use [[Void-safety: Background, definition, and tools#Self-initializing attributes|self-initializing attributes]] widely. And in a way, you would be correct. But you should also understand that there is a price to pay for using self-initializing attributes and stable attributes. It is that upon every access, an evaluation of the state of the attribute must be made. So, as a general rule, you should avoid using self-initializing attributes only for the purpose of lazy initialization.


==More about the ''attached syntax''==

The complete attached syntax is:
<code>
		attached {SOME_TYPE} exp as l_exp
</code>
In this section, we will see more ways in which to use this versatile language facility.

===As a CAP-like construct which yields a local variable===

In the introduction to the attached syntax, we used an example which showed how the attached syntax is directly relevant to void-safety. That is, the code: 
<code>
            if x /= Void then
--              ... Any other instructions here that do not assign to x
                x.f (a)
            end
</code>

is a CAP for <code>x</code> ... but that's only true if <code>x</code> is a local variable or a formal argument to the routine that contains the code. 

So to access a detachable attribute safely,  we could declare a local variable, make an assignment, and test for <code>Void</code> as above. Something like this:
<code>
    my_detachable_attribute: detachable MY_TYPE

            ...
    some_routine
        local
           x: like my_detachable_attribute
        do
            x := my_detachable_attribute
            if x /= Void then
--              ... Any other instructions here that do not assign to x
                x.f (a)
            end
                ...
</code>
The attached syntax can both check the attached status of a detachable attribute and also provide a new local variable. So the routine becomes:
<code>
    some_routine
        do
            if attached my_detachable_attribute as x then
--                  ... Any other instructions here that do not assign to x
                x.f (a)
            end
                ...
</code>

===As a test for attachment===

In its simplest form, the attached syntax can be used to test attached status only:
<code>
            if attached x then
                do_something
            else
                do_something_different
            end
</code>

So in this simple form, <code>attached x</code> can be used instead of <code>x /= Void</code>. The two are semantically equivalent, and which one you choose is a matter of personal preference. 


===As a tool for "once per object"===

There is a code pattern for functions that exists in some Eiffel software to effect "once-per-object / lazy evaluation". 

{{note|As of EiffelStudio version 6.6, the use of this code pattern effecting "once per object" is no longer necessary. V6.6 includes explicit support for <code>once</code> routines which can be adjusted by a [[ET: Once routines and shared objects#Adjusting once semantics with "once keys"|once key]] to specify once per object.}}

This "once-per-object" code pattern employs a cached value for some object which is not exported. When it is applied, the "once-per-object" function checks the attachment status of the cached value. If the cached value is void, then it is created and assigned to <code>Result</code>. If the cached value was found already to exist, then it is just assigned to <code>Result</code>. 

Here's an example of this pattern used to produce some descriptive text of an instance of its class:

<code>
feature -- Access

    descriptive_text: STRING
        local
            l_result: like descriptive_text_cache
        do
            l_result := descriptive_text_cache
            if l_result = Void then
                create Result.make_empty
--			... Build Result with appropriate descriptive text for Current
                descriptive_text_cache := Result
            else
                Result := l_result
            end
        ensure
            result_attached: Result /= Void
            result_not_empty: not Result.is_empty
            result_consistent: Result = descriptive_text
        end

feature {NONE} -- Implementation

    descriptive_text_cache: like descriptive_text

</code>
This example will not compile in a void-safe project (assuming types are attached by default). The problem is that the attribute <code>descriptive_text_cache</code> is of an attached type, therefore will be flagged by the compiler as not properly set (VEVI). Of course, it will be ... that's the whole idea here: not to initialize <code>descriptive_text_cache</code> until it's actually used. So it sounds like <code>descriptive_text_cache</code> should be declared detachable. That is:
<code>
    descriptive_text_cache: detachable like descriptive_text
</code>
This change will make this routine compile in a void-safe project. But you should notice that there is a ripple-down effect due to the change. Within the routine, <code>l_result</code> is typed <code>like descriptive_text_cache</code>, so it also will be detachable. Therefore we might expect trouble, because later in the routine we have:
<code>
                Result := l_result
</code>
Because we know Result is attached and l_result is detachable, we might expect a compiler error in which the source of an assignment does not conform to its target (VJAR). 

But we don't get such an error. The reason is two-fold. First, <code>l_result</code> is a local variable whose use can be protected by a CAP. Second, the CAP in this case is the check to ensure that <code>l_result</code> is not void. We only make the assignment to <code>Result</code> if <code>l_result</code> is not void. So the compiler can prove that <code>l_result</code> cannot be void at the point at which the assignment occurs ... therefore, no error.

Because the '''attached syntax''' can test attached status and provide a local variable, it can be used to remove some unnecessary code from this routine. The version of the routine that follows shows the attached syntax being used to test the attached status of <code>descriptive_text_cache</code> and yield the local variable <code>l_result</code> in the case that <code>descriptive_text_cache</code> is indeed attached. 
<code>
    descriptive_text: STRING
        do
            if attached descriptive_text_cache as l_result then
                Result := l_result
            else
                create Result.make_empty
--			... Build Result with appropriate descriptive text for Current
                descriptive_text_cache := Result
            end
        ensure
            result_attached: Result /= Void
            result_not_empty: not Result.is_empty
            result_consistent: Result = descriptive_text
    end

feature {NONE} -- Implementation

    descriptive_text_cache: like descriptive_text

</code>


===As a replacement for assignment attempt===

The assignment attempt ( <code>?=</code> ) has traditionally been used to deal with external objects (e.g., persistent objects from files and databases) and to narrow the type of an object in order to use more specific features. The latter is a process known by names such as "down casting" in some technological circles. A classic example is doing specific processing on some elements of a polymorphic data structure. Let's look at an example. Suppose we have a <code>LIST</code> of items of type <code>POLYGON</code>:
<code>
    my_polygons: LIST [POLYGON]
</code>
<code>POLYGON</code>s could be of many specific types, and one of those could be <code>RECTANGLE</code>. Suppose too that we want to print the measurements of the diagonals of all the <code>RECTANGLE</code>s in the list. Class <code>RECTANGLE</code> might have a query <code>diagonal</code> returning such a measurement, but <code>POLYGON</code> would not, for the reason that the concept of diagonal is not meaningful for all <code>POLYGON</code>s, e.g., <code>TRIANGLE</code>s.

As we traverse the list we would use assignment attempt to try to attach each <code>POLYGON</code> to a variable typed as <code>RECTANGLE</code>. If successful, we can print the result of the application of <code>diagonal</code>. 
<code>
    l_my_rectangle: RECTANGLE

                ...
            from
                my_polygons.start
            until
                my_polygons.exhausted
            loop
                l_my_rectangle ?= my_polygons.item
                if l_my_rectangle /= Void then
                    print (l_my_rectangle.diagonal)
                    print ("%N")
                end
                my_polygons.forth
            end
</code>
The '''attached syntax''' allows us to check both attached status and type, and provides us with a fresh local variable when appropriate:
<code>
            from
                my_polygons.start
            until
                my_polygons.exhausted
            loop
                if attached {RECTANGLE} my_polygons.item as l_my_rectangle then
                    print (l_my_rectangle.diagonal)
                    print ("%N")
                end
                my_polygons.forth
            end
</code>
As with the other examples of the '''attached syntax''', it is no longer necessary to make a declaration for the local variable, in this case <code>l_my_rectangle</code>.


==More about CAPs==

===Use of <code>check</code> instructions===

In void-safe mode, the compiler will accept code that it can prove will only apply features to attached references at runtime ... and you help this process along by using the tools of void-safety, like attached types and CAPs. On the other hand, the compiler will reject code that it cannot guarantee is void-safe. Sometimes this may cause you a problem. There may be subtle situations in which you feel quite certain that a section of code will be free of void calls at runtime, but the compiler doesn't see it the same way, and rejects your code. In cases like this, you can usually satisfy the compiler by using <code>check</code> instructions.

Technically speaking, <code>check</code> instructions are not CAPs. But they are useful in cases in which an entity is always expected to be attached at a certain point in the code. In the following example, the attribute <code>my_detachable_any</code> is detachable. But at the particular point at which it is the source of the assignment to <code>l_result</code>, it is expected always to be attached. If it is not attached at the time of the assignment, and therefore <code>l_result</code> becomes void, then an exception should occur. The <code>check</code> instruction provides this behavior.

The following sample shows the <code>check</code> instruction at work. There are reasons why this is not the best use use of <code>check</code> in this case, and we will discuss that next.

<code>
                -- A not-so-good example of using check.

    my_detachable_any: detachable ANY
            ...
    my_attached_any: ANY
        local
            l_result: like my_detachable_any
        do
            l_result := my_detachable_any
            check
                attached l_result 
            end
            Result := l_result
        end
</code>

Here the assertion in the <code>check</code> guarantees that <code>l_result</code> is attached at the time of its assignment to <code>Result</code>. If <code>my_detachable_any</code> is ever not attached to an object, then an exception will be raised. 

So what's wrong with the sample above? It would be fine in ''workbench'' code, but what happens if the code is in ''finalized'' mode, in which assertions are typically discarded?

The answer is that the <code>check</code> in the sample above would no longer be effective, and the resulting executable would no longer be void-safe.

The solution to this problem is found in a different form of the <code>check</code> instruction. Consider the same example, but this time using <code>check ... then ... end</code>:

<code>
                -- A better way of using check.

    my_detachable_any: detachable ANY
            ...
    my_attached_any: ANY
        do
            check attached my_detachable_any as l_result then
                Result := l_result
            end
        end
</code>

Here, in the improved version of the example, the <code>check ... then ... end</code> is used along with the <code>attached</code> syntax. This streamlines the code a bit by eliminating the need to declare a separate local entity, while achieving the same effect as the previous example. If <code>my_detachable_any</code> is attached at runtime, then the temporary variable <code>l_result</code> is created and attached to the same object. Then the body of the <code>check ... then ... end</code> is executed. If <code>my_detachable_any</code> is not attached, an exception occurs.

Another important benefit, one that solves the problem with the original example, comes from the way in which <code>check ... then ... end</code> is handled by the compiler. The <code>check ... then ... end</code> form '''is always monitored, even if assertion checking is turned off at all levels''', as is usually done in finalized code.

===Choosing CAPs versus the Attached Syntax===

The attached syntax is convenient because it can check attached status and deliver a new local variable at the same time. But there are cases in which you might choose instead to define a local variable and use a CAP. Suppose you had code acting on several similar and detachable expressions, and you use the attached syntax in each case:
<code>
    foobar
        do
            if attached dictionary_entry ("abc") as l_abc then
                l_abc.do_something
            end
            if attached dictionary_entry ("def") as l_def then
                l_def.do_something
            end
            if attached dictionary_entry ("ghi") as l_ghi then
                l_ghi.do_something
            end
        end
</code>
This routine causes three local variables to be allocated for the duration of routine <code>foobar</code>, one each for <code>l_abc</code>, <code>l_def</code>, and <code>l_ghi</code>. And it is no better to do this:
<code>
    foobar
        do
            if attached dictionary_entry ("abc") as l_entry then
                l_entry.do_something
            end
            if attached dictionary_entry ("def") as l_entry then
                l_entry.do_something
            end
            if attached dictionary_entry ("ghi") as l_entry then
                l_entry.do_something
            end
        end
</code>
Even though the names are the same, still three separate local variables are allocated for <code>foobar</code>.

In cases like this, you could effect a minor performance improvement by declaring one local variable and reusing it. In the following code, only one local variable is used and access to it is protected by the CAP <code>if l_entry /= Void then</code>. 
<code>
    foobar
       local
          l_entry: like dictionary_entry
       do
          l_entry := dictionary_entry ("abc")
          if l_entry /= Void then
                l_entry.do_something
          end
          l_entry := dictionary_entry ("def")
          if l_entry /= Void then
                l_entry.do_something
          end
          l_entry := dictionary_entry ("ghi")
          if l_entry /= Void then
                l_entry.do_something
          end
    end
</code>

==Stable attributes==

Remember that stable attributes are actually detachable attributes, with the difference that they can never be the target of an assignment in which the source is <code>Void</code> or anything that could have a value of <code>Void</code>.

Stable attributes are useful in situations in which there are valid object life scenarios in which some particular attribute will never need an object attached, or will only need an object attached late in the scenario. So in this case, the attribute is used only under certain runtime conditions. Declaring these attributes as stable eliminates the need to make attachments during object creation. Yet once needed, that is, once the attribute is attached, it will always be attached.

Also, you should remember that unlike other attributes, you can access stable attributes directly in a CAP:
<code>
    my_stable_attribute: detachable SOME_TYPE
        note
            option: stable
        attribute
        end

            ...

            if my_stable_attribute /= Void then
                my_stable_attribute.do_something
            end

            ...
</code>
