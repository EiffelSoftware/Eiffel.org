==The EiffelBase Library==

Type: Library <br/>
Platform: Any <br/>
Availability: Open Source, IFFEL License. 

The EiffelBase class library, covered by the open-source IFFEL license, is one of the principal contributions of Eiffel: a library of fundamental structures and algorithms covering the basics of computing, and resulting from a "Linnaean" effort at a general-purpose taxonomy of computing structures. EiffelBase is one of the most carefully designed and extensively used libraries in the object-oriented industry.
