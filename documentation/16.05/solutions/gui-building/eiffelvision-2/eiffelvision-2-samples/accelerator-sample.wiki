==Compiling==

* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\vision2\accelerator\''. 
* Choose ''accelerator.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Click '''OK'''. 


==Running==
After launching the application, you will see a window displayed with a similar appearance to the one above. When the window has the focus, the key combination Ctrl + Q will exit the application. 
==Under the Hood==
An EV_ACCELERATOR is created and associated with the EV_TITLED_WINDOW used for the main window of the application. The association is made by adding the accelerator to the accelerators list of the window.
