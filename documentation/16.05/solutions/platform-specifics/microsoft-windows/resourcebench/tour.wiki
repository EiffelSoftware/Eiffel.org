1 - Launch the Resource Bench application. This small dialog box will appear for the initialization process: 

[[Image:retriev]]  

Then you get the main window of Resource Bench: 

[[Image:rb]]  

2 - Open a resource file (why not the example.rc file provided with this release of Resource Bench). Let the application parse the file. You will see a dialog box that informs you of the parsings state. <br/>
First, there is the preprocessing of the resource file: 

[[Image:prepro]]  

Then you have the analysis phase: 

[[Image:analyz]]  

3 - After these two steps you will see a hierarchical view of the resource file that show you what resource's type are included in the resource file (Below the result of the "example.rc" file). 

[[Image:collaps]]  

You can expand the tree view to see associated resources for each resource's type. 

[[Image:expand]]  

At this point you are able to: 
* Select some properties for the Eiffel code generation
* Save a project file
* Generate Eiffel Code
* Regenerate the same resource file (the third point is very useful when you have a Resource Bench Project and do not have the original resource file that permits its creation).


4 - To save a project file, click on the save button of the toolbar or select the save item in the file menu. A standard save dialog box will appear in which you can specify the file name of your project. The file's extension for a Resource Bench project is "*.prb" 

5 - To generate Eiffel Code, select the "Generate Eiffel Code..." item in the Build menu, this dialog box will appear to ask you in which directory Resource Bench must save the Eiffel classes: 

[[Image:browse]]  

6 - To generate a resource file, select the "Generate Resource file..." item in the Build menu, a standard save dialog box will appear to save the file.
