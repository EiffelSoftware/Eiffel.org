==Under the Hood==

Although this system does nothing except create and display a [[ref:/libraries/wel/reference/wel_frame_window_chart|WEL_FRAME_WINDOW]] , it shows how to set up your first [[ref:/libraries/wel/reference/wel_application_chart|WEL_APPLICATION]] . 

This sample only contains one class, TUTORIAL_STEP1 which inherits [[ref:/libraries/wel/reference/wel_application_chart|WEL_APPLICATION]]  and redefines <code>main_window</code>
