==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\wel\tree_view\''. 
* Choose ''tree_view.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Click '''OK'''. 

==Running==

After launching the program, a window will be displayed as illustrated above. Selecting or expanding one of the tree items will cause notification to be displayed in the list at the top of the window. Various other notifications are also displayed, such as pressing a key in the tree. 

==Under the Hood==

<code>TREEVIEW</code> inherits [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_tree_view_chart|WEL_TREE_VIEW]]  and redefines make to initialize items within the tree. A [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_tree_view_insert_struct_chart|WEL_TREE_VIEW_INSERT_STRUCT]]  is used to insert each [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_tree_view_item_chart|WEL_TREE_VIEW_ITEM]]  while a [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_image_list_chart|WEL_IMAGE_LIST]]  is used to reference images within the tree. 
This sample contains the following classes: 
* <code>TREEVIEW</code>
* <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code>
* <code>TREEVIEW_DEMO</code>
* <code>APPLICATION_IDS</code>
