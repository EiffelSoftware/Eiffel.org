When you inherit [[ref:/libraries/wel/reference/wel_application_chart|WEL_APPLICATION]] , you will need to implement the deferred feature main_window as a once function. This will be the main window of your application, and can be any descendent of [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_composite_window_chart|WEL_COMPOSITE_WINDOW]] .
