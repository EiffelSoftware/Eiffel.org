==Overview==

A Control is a window which provides a means of interacting with the application. For example, the [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_edit_chart|WEL_EDIT]]  control provides a user with the means of entering and modifying text. There are many common controls available within this cluster, each with a specific use.

{{note|Each control inherits from [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_control_chart|WEL_CONTROL]]  which is a descendent of [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_window_chart|WEL_WINDOW]]  This provides the control with a large number of general features (including full window functionality). Each control also provides its own feature set which give access to specific properties of that control. }}

==Creating controls==

Each type of control generally has its own creation procedure that is specific to the type of control. For example, [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_scroll_bar_chart|WEL_SCROLL_BAR]]  has two creation procedures; make_vertical and make_horizontal. Depending on which of these two creation procedures used, you will get a scroll bar aligned vertically or horizontally.
