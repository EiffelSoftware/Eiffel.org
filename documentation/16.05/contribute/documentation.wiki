= Current documentation system =
* The documentation is written using wikitext syntax (similar to wikipedia).
* Each documentation page is stored in a wiki file on disk.
* Those files come from the subversion repository: [https://svn.eiffel.com/eiffel-org/trunk/documentation/trunk] .
* The outline of book are following the underlying directory structure, and each wiki file can have properties that hold metadata such as:
:<nowiki>[[Property:title|The page title]]</nowiki>
:<nowiki>[[Property:link_title|short title]]</nowiki>
:<nowiki>[[Property:weight|5]]</nowiki>
** '''link_title''' is used to have a short title in menu, or various links.
** '''weight''' is used to order sibling pages (lower weight goes before, upper weight goes after).
