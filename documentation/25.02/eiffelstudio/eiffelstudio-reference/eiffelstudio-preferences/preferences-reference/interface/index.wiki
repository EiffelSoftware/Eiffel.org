This section of the documentation describes preferences that belong to the "Interface" category. This group contains two kinds of properties, some related to the preferences for the EiffelStudio [[Development Window Preferences|development window]], others that define which [[Discardable dialogs|dialog windows]] should or should not be displayed. You can also decide to use animated icons in the status bars whenever possible (that is, during compilations and executions).
