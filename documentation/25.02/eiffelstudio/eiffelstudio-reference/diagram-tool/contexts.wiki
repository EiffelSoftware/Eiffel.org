A diagram in the diagram tool is always the context of a certain class or cluster. Context means the direct relations up to a certain depth.

For clusters, the relations are:
* subclusters
* superclusters

The relations for classes are:
* ancestors
* descendants
* clients
* suppliers
This is an example of the class <eiffel>LIST</eiffel>, with ancestor depth 2, descendant depth 2 and both client and supplier depth zero. <div>  [[Image:bon-list-relations]]  </div><br/>
