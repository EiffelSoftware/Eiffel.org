The Eiffel compiler offers the possibility to generate a '''dynamic shared library''' based on the system. 

Thanks to this dynamic library, it is possible to call Eiffel features from a C program, by using the real names of the features.

In other words, the user can generate a DLL ''(*.dll)'' using features of the system on windows, and/or a shared library ''(*.so)'' on Unix. 

For that, the user has first to describe what he wants to export in his dynamic library. This is done via a definition file ''(*.def)'', which specifies what features should be exported. A [[Dynamic library builder|wizard]]  helps build the definition file, which makes this step very intuitive. The second step is to select the definition file in the [[Advanced Options|project settings]]  to take this definition file into account. This done, the next compilation of the system will yield [[Dynamic library: Generated files|C files]]  that can be used to create the shared library.
