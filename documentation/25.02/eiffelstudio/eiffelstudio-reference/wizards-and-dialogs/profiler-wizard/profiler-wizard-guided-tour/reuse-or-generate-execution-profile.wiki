The second screen of the wizard lets you reuse a previously generated ''Execution Profile'' or generate a new ''Execution Profile'' from a ''Run-time information record''. 

The profiler wizard has detected that one or more ''Execution Profiles'' have already been generated for this system in this compilation mode. If you have executed your system after the generation of the existing profile, select '''Generate a profile from Run-time information record''' to create a new ''Execution Profile'' for the newly produced ''Run-time information record''. 

{{note|If you choose '''Generate a profile from Run-time information record''' the generated ''Execution Profile'' will be written into: <br/><br/>''<project_directory>/EIFGENa/target_name/W_CODE/profinfo.pfi'' <br/><br/>if you have selected '''Workbench mode''' in the first step, or into: <br/><br/>''<project_directory>/EIFGENs/target_name/F_CODE/profinfo.pfi'' <br/><br/>if you have selected '''Finalized mode'''. If a file with the same name already exists its content will be destroyed and replaced. }}
<br/>

However, if you have not executed your system since the generation of the last ''Execution Profile'', there is no need to generate a new ''Execution Profile''. If you are in the latter case, select '''Use existing profile''' and choose the last ''Execution Profile'' you have generated. 

{{tip|If you want to archive different ''Execution Profiles'' (to compare them for example), rename the ''profinfo.pfi'' file into a new name but keep the .pfi extension. The profiler wizard detects existing Execution Profiles by checking the file extensions. }}

Clicking '''Next''' will lead you to the [[Select a Run-time information record to generate the Execution Profile|Third state]]  if you have selected '''Generate a profile from Run-time information record'''. On the other hand if you have selected '''Use existing profile''' you will go to the [[Select the information you need and formulate your query|Final state]] .
