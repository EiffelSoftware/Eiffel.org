This cluster contains all the dialogs provided by EiffelVision 2. 

==Standard Dialog Boxes==

A standard dialog box provides a way of interacting with the underlying platform (such as Windows or Linux) to perform basic tasks such as opening a file or printing a document. EiffelVision 2 provides six standard dialogs that allow the user to perform common tasks.  They are:
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_color_dialog_chart|EV_COLOR_DIALOG]]  — allows the user to select an RGB color (useful for graphical apps such as a Paint Program). 
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_directory_dialog_chart|EV_DIRECTORY_DIALOG]]  — allows the user to select a directory. 
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_file_open_dialog_chart|EV_FILE_OPEN_DIALOG]]  — allows the user to select an existing file to be opened. 
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_file_save_dialog_chart|EV_FILE_SAVE_DIALOG]]  — allows the user to select a filename to be used for creation of a file. 
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_font_dialog_chart|EV_FONT_DIALOG]]  — allows the user to select a font (useful for a Word Processor for example). 
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_print_dialog_chart|EV_PRINT_DIALOG]]  — allows the user to confirm or change printer settings for printing (may be used in conjunction with [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_print_projector_chart|EV_PRINT_PROJECTOR]]). 


==Creating Custom Dialog Boxes==

If you wish to provide a custom dialog in your application, [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_dialog_chart| EV_DIALOG]]  has been provided to facilitate this. 


==Message Dialog Boxes==

A message dialog box gives your application a standard way of displaying information, or asking simple questions.  This information can be displayed with the following message dialog boxes. 
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_message_dialog_chart|EV_MESSAGE_DIALOG]]  — displays a simple message with an "OK" button. 
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_information_dialog_chart|EV_INFORMATION_DIALOG]]  — displays information to the user (in Windows this dialog box contains an "information" icon). 
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_question_dialog_chart|EV_QUESTION_DIALOG]]  — displays a question and allows user to respond with "Yes" or "No" button.
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_warning_dialog_chart|EV_WARNING_DIALOG]]  — displays a warning to the user. 
*  [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_confirmation_dialog_chart|EV_CONFIRMATION_DIALOG]]  — allows the user to confirm an action that has been requested.
