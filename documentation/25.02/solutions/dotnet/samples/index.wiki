In this chapter you will find a series of examples that will permit to you to understand the bases of programming with Dotnet.

However, you should be familiar with Object-Oriented programming model. Almost all other examples can also be built for .NET if the dotnet target is choosen instead of classic.

{{Caution|Those examples were initially built for Eiffel .NET framework and may not work with .NETCore (net6.0, net7.0, ...) }}

{{Recommended|Visit the GitHub organization [https://github.com/EiffelNETCore] for more '''.NETCore examples''' (Machine Learning, ASP.NETCore, ...) using EiffelStudio .NET. }}
