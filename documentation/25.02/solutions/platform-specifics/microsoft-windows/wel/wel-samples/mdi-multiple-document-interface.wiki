==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\wel\mdi\''. 
* Choose ''mdi.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Click '''OK'''. 

==Running==
After launching the program, a window will be displayed as illustrated above. Selecting "New" from the "File" menu will create a new child window, while selecting "Close" will close the currently selected child window. The options available on the "Window" menu allow positioning of the child windows. Selecting "Exit" from the "File" menu or closing the window manually will exit the program. 
==Under the Hood==
<code>MAIN_WINDOW</code> inherits [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_mdi_frame_window_chart|WEL_MDI_FRAME_WINDOW]]  to provide the multiple document interface behavior while each child window is of type [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_mdi_child_window_chart|WEL_MDI_CHILD_WINDOW]] . When "Close" is selected from the "File" menu, the feature <code>active_window</code> from [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_mdi_frame_window_chart|WEL_MDI_FRAME_WINDOW]]  is used to select the window that must be closed. 
This sample contains the following classes: 
* <code>APPLICATION_IDS</code>
* <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code>
* <code>MDI_DEMO</code>
