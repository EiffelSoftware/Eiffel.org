First reviews the principles of library construction and the object-oriented techniques that make it possible to build high-quality libraries - e.g., finding the right objects and classes, choosing the proper names, using inheritance properly, determining the ideal class size, etc. 

Then provides detailed usage descriptions of hundreds of reusable components, offering thousands of directly usable operations. The components, written in Eiffel, cover such areas as lists, chains, queues, stacks, trees of various kinds, sorted structures, lexical analysis, parsing, and many other fundamental data structures and algorithms. 

For both the users of reusable software libraries and for developers who are interested in building their own libraries of reusable software.
