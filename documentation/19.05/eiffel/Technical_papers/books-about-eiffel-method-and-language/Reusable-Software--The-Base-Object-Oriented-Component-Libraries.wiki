Reuse is a required condition of any progress in software, yet until now the subject has been largely ignored in the literature. This book provides both the components and the expertise for developing reusable software — the components are reusable software modules which cover some of the fundamental patterns of software development across application areas; the expertise will help readers not just to use these modules properly, but also to develop their own libraries and make sure they are successful. First reviews the principles of library construction and the object-oriented techniques that make it possible to build high-quality libraries — e.g., finding the right objects and classes, choosing the proper names, using inheritance properly, determining the ideal class size, etc. Then provides detailed usage descriptions of hundreds of reusable components, offering thousands of directly usable operations. The components, written in Eiffel, cover such areas as lists, chains, queues, stacks, trees of various kinds, sorted structures, lexical analysis, parsing, and many other fundamental data structures and algorithms. For both the users of reusable software libraries and for developers who are interested in building their own libraries of reusable software.
