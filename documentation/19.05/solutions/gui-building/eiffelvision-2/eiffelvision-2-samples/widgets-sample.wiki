==Compiling==

* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\vision2\widgets\''. 
* Choose ''widgets.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Click '''OK'''. 


==Running==

After launching the application, you will see a window displayed with a similar appearance to the one above. You may exit the application at any time, by clicking on the close icon, or you may select "exit" from the "File" menu. Selected "Help", "about" displays a dialog with details about the application. 

The left hand side of the main window contains a tree, showing the widgets available within EiffelVision 2. If you select one of these widgets in the tree, then the type of widget you selected will be displayed in the middle of the main_window. Controls will also the be available to the right hand side of the widget, which allow you to modify its state. These controls do not represent all the available feature of the widget, but demonstrate many of the most common. The text area below the currently selected widget displays the events that have occurred on the widget. Only those events inherited by EV_WIDGET are displayed.
