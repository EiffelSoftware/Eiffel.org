If the current [[Object editor|object editor]]  contains an <eiffel>EV_CONTAINER</eiffel> [[EiffelBuild Notation|object]] , then the following control will be available: 

[[Image:empty-radio-merge]]  

With this control, you can merge two or more instances of <eiffel>EV_CONTAINER</eiffel> together, so that any <eiffel>EV_RADIO_BUTTON</eiffel> contained are grouped.

==Merging==

To create a new merge, [[EiffelBuild Notation|pick]]  an [[EiffelBuild Notation|object]]  of type <eiffel>EV_CONTAINER</eiffel>, and [[EiffelBuild Notation|drop]]  it anywhere on the control. This will merge the radio button group of the <eiffel>EV_CONTAINER</eiffel> referenced in the object editor, to the transported one. Each merge, will show up as a new item in the control. 
{{note|Container objects may only be grouped once, and as such, you will not be permitted to add an [[EiffelBuild Notation|object]]  that is already contained in the list. }}


==Unmerging==

To unmerge a container [[EiffelBuild Notation|object]]  from a group, [[EiffelBuild Notation|pick]]  the representation of that [[EiffelBuild Notation|object]]  from the list, and [[EiffelBuild Notation|drop]]  on  [[Image:icon-delete-small-color]] . This will unmerge the [[EiffelBuild Notation|object]]  from the current group of containers. 

==Locating group member==

To locate the [[EiffelBuild Notation|object]]  referenced by a list item in the control, left click the item that you wish to locate. This will display the representation of the associated [[EiffelBuild Notation|object]]  within the [[Layout constructor|layout constructor]] , and the associated icon will be animated for a short period of time.
