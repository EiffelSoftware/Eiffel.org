You will want to rely not on a single metric but on a combination of metrics:

{{definition|Metric framework|A '''metric framework''' is a set of definitions of metrics. }}


Any metric work should be backed by a theory:

{{definition|Metric theory|A '''metric theory''' is a combination of: <br/>
- A metric framework <br/>
- A set of definitions of attributes (qualitative or quantitative) <br/>
- A mapping from the framework to the set of attributes, representing the hypothesis that each metric is a good predictor of the associated attribute }}

This note does not introduce a metric theory, but defines a metric framework by introducing a number of metrics.
