The new feature command  [[Image:new-feature-icon]] located in the [[Features tool|features tool]]  acts like the [[New feature dialog|main new feature command]] . Clicking it pops up the same dialog, making it possible to add a new feature in the currently edited class. 

This command is only available when the class currently in the editor is compiled, can be modified, and has a file on the disk (this may not be the case if the class is precompiled).
