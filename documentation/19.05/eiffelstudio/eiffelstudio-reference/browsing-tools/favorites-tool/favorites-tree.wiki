The favorites tree gives a graphical representation of the favorite classes of the system, as opposed to the favorites menu.

In this tree, the folders are user-definable through the [[Organize favorites dialog|Organize Favorites dialog]] . They have no other goal than ordering the favorites. In particular, they are entirely independent from the clusters of the system. 

Clicking a class in the favorites tree edits it. Keyboard navigation is also available. Favorite classes are [[Pick-and-drop mechanism|pickable]]  too, so that it is possible to send them to all interface components that accept classes.
