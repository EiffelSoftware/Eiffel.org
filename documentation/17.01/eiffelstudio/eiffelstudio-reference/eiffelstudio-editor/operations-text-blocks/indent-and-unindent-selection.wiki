EiffelStudio editor offers the possibility to indent or unindent selected lines.

*  The "Indent" command corresponds to the '''Indent selection''' entry in the '''Advanced''' sub menu of the [[Edit menu commands| '''Edit''' Menu ]]. It may be called by using the keyboard shortcut "Tab". Its action is to insert a tabulation in front of each [[Selection|selected]] line. 

*  The "Unindent" command corresponds to the '''Unindent selection''' entry in the '''Advanced''' sub menu of the [[Edit menu commands| '''Edit''' Menu ]]. It may be called by using the keyboard shortcut "Shift+Tab". Its action is to remove the tabulation in front of each [[Selection|selected]] line if there is such a character. <br/>



{{note|If there is no selection, you may still use the unindent shortcut "Shift+Tab". The command will be applied to the current line. }}
