Located in the '''debug''' menu and the '''project''' toolbar, three commands allow you to change the state of set [[Breakpoints|breakpoints]] in the system. 

Enable breakpoints (  [[Image:16x16--breakpoints-enable-icon]]  ), disable breakpoints (  [[Image:16x16--breakpoints-disable-icon]]  ) and remove breakpoints (  [[Image:breakpoints-delete-icon]]  ) all have global and local actions. Left-clicking on them has a global action: all breakpoints currently set in the system will be respectively enabled, disabled, or discarded. However, it is also possible to [[Pick-and-drop mechanism|drop]]  a feature or a class onto them, in which case only set breakpoints of the feature/class will be affected. 

Note that these commands work only on set breakpoints (that is, enabled or disabled breakpoints). Therefore, discarded breakpoints cannot be set again with these commands.
