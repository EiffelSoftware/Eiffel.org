The profile query window displays the results of the query you have formulated in the [[Select the information you need and formulate your query|Final state]]  of the Profiler wizard. It also lets you change the sub queries of the current query. 

To add a new sub query to the current query, fill in the text field labeled '''Define new sub query''' (type in ''calls <20'' for example) and click the '''And''' or '''Or''' button. To display the results of the new query click on the '''Update''' button. 

To remove an existing sub query, select it in the '''Active query''' list and click on the '''Inactivate >''' button. 

To activate an existing sub query, select it in the '''Inactive query''' list and click on the '''< Activate''' button. 

To change the operator affecting an existing sub query, select it in either the '''Active query''' or the '''Inactive query''' list and click on the '''Or''' or '''And''' button. 

Click on the '''Save''' button to save the currently displayed results in a text file. 

{{tip|To visualize the result in Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet, select the entire text (except the first three lines where the Execution Profile file is specified), copy it and then paste it into Excel. }}
