In the header comment field you can type a description of the feature. For style guidelines in writing a header comment, see [[Object-Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition]], chapter 26, section 4. The description should be informative, clear and terse. 

For example, suppose you have an attribute <eiffel>count</eiffel>. You can enter the following header comment: 
<div>  [[Image:feature-wizard-comment]]  </div><br/>
When clicking '''OK''' this code is generated: <br/>
<code>
    count: INTEGER
            -- Number of students in course</code>
