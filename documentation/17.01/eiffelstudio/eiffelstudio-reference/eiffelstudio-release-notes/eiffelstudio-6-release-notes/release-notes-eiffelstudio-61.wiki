==Graphical environment==

===What's new===
* New default layout for EiffelStudio tools to highlight the most common used tools whereas other tools are still available at the bottom or via the View menu.
* New Errors and Warnings tool. It replaces the former Errors tool and Warnings tool and provides a nicer way to show errors and filtering them.
* Revisited all the dialogs to provide a nicer and consistent look and feel.
* Multiple errors are reported for each compilation degree.

===Improvements===
* Use the default OS font for displaying tooltips.
* C compilation failure will now show up as an error in the new Errors and Warnings tool.
* Completion list will now show immediately after pressing '.' when the completion list is active.
* Added ability to submit a problem report within EiffelStudio when it quits unexpectedly.

===Changes===
* Support for the MinGW C compiler on Windows 32-bit. Borland is officially not supported anymore.
* Completion list no longer shows obsolete items by default (set via a preference option).

===Bug fixes===
* Fixed incorrect results when using the profiler with a finalized system.
* More bug fixes can be seen at [http://dev.eiffel.com/EiffelStudio_6.1_Releases the EiffelStudio open source site] .

==Debugger==
===Graphical environment===

* Better dialog to change the layout of the Objects tool grid. It is possible to easily change the order of 'Current, arguments, locals, ...'.
