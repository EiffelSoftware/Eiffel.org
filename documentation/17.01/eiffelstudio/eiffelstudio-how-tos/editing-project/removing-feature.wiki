To remove a feature, you may of course delete the corresponding lines in the class text. You can also use the Diagram tool if it is an attribute or a function. To do so, make sure that supplier links are shown in the diagram (if  [[Image:diagram-supplier-link-icon]]  is not pressed, click it). Pick the link that correspond to the feature you want to remove and drop the pebble on  [[Image:16x16--general-delete-icon]] .
