'''Guide to Eiffel Information'''

These pages are the central repository of information about Eiffel and the products and technologies of Eiffel Software. They cover the online documentation, but also link to many valuable resources outside the documentation set.

If you are interested in [[Learning Eiffel|learning Eiffel, there is a list of resources]] dedicated to that purpose. 

The online documentation is organized into virtual books. Each book covers an important aspect of the world of Eiffel. For cases in which it is not always possible to use the online version of the documentation, all or selected parts of the documentation set can be [[Offline use of the Eiffel documentation|downloaded for offline use]].

===[[Examples]] -- Contributor supported examples of Eiffel solutions to common programming problems===

:Let's build a set of examples that can be shared on popular WWW program chrestomathies. 

===[[Community]] -- You can contribute to the documentation!===

:EiffelStudio documentation is available in a convenient Wiki format. This makes it possible to improve the documentation continuously and make sure it is always up to date.



'''Community input''' is welcome. If you are interested in improving and developing EiffelStudio documentation, you can become a ''contributor'' or ''editor'':

* Contributors can edit existing pages in any book and add pages to Community Contributions books.

* Editors can modify and add pages in any book (including adding Community Contribution pages to an existing book).

To become a contributor, you should be proficient in Eiffel technology and have good written English skills. To become an editor, you should already have made significant improvements or additions as a contributor.

If you are interested in becoming a contributor, please send an email to info@eiffel.com with a short description of your Eiffel experience and any other relevant background. We look forward to your contributions!

==[[uuid:b8c10baa-4f50-adfe-a6f8-9cb56a8f1917|Glossary of Object Technology]]==

----


This is a relatively comprehensive glossary of terms used in Object-Oriented Analysis, Design, and programming, but are not specific to the Eiffel Language, since object-oriented principles can be applied to any programming language.  It contains all the terms from the glossary in [[Object-Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition]], plus others used in this website, added for clarity and ease of reference.

This glossary is useful all by itself, since a review of it can serve as a refresher (in case you have been away from Object Technology for a while).  It is used in this website to assist the reader by providing easy links to technical terms that are used throughout the website.

Additionally, it is possible to link to terms in this glossary from other websites by using links that look like this:

:<nowiki>http://docs.eiffel.com/book/guide/glossary-object-technology#Attribute</nowiki>

or a version that will survive the page being moved:

:<nowiki>http://docs.eiffel.com/isedoc/uuid/b8c10baa-4f50-adfe-a6f8-9cb56a8f1917#Attribute</nowiki>

Note that the anchor (the part after the "#") has to be spelled and capitalized exactly like the term on the page.  (Use underscore characters to replace spaces.)
