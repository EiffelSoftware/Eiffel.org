The EiffelPreferences library is a platform independent library that can be used to add preference and configuration settings to your application. Briefly, the library provides support for creating fully configurable preference values, on a per application or per user basis. It also provides a graphical interface for manipulation of these values, and a easily extensible design for you to add your own custom preference types.
