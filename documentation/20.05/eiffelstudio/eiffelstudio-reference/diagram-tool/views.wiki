Every class or cluster has one or more views. Every view shows the [[Contexts|context]]  of a class or cluster, a subset of the Eiffel system. For example, for a certain cluster, you can show only the hierarchy of the classes in it, but you could have a second view that shows only a couple of classes in it, but with all relations between them.

The view combo box, as seen in the image above, can be used to add a view or switch to a previously added one. Every class and cluster has a view "DEFAULT" that is generated automatically. If you create a new view and move for example a class around in it, the "DEFAULT" view is unaffected.

The Diagram tool provides you with the following possibilities to manipulate views:
*  [[Adding a view|Adding a view]]  
*  [[Deleting a view|Deleting a view]]  
*  [[Showing or hiding links and labels|Showing or hiding links and labels]]  
*  [[Removing items from a view|Removing items from a view]]  
*  [[Changing colors of classes|Changing colors of objects]]  
*  [[Using the link tool|Using the link tool]]  
*  [[Changing system exploration depth|Changing system exploration depth of objects]]  
*  [[Retrieving all classes into a cluster|Retrieving all classes into a cluster]]  
*  [[Iconifying and restoring a cluster|Minimizing a cluster and restoring it to its normal state]]
