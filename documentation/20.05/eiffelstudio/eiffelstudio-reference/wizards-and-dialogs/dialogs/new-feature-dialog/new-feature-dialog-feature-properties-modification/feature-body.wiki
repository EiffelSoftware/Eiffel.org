What goes into the feature body field is dependent on what kind of feature you wish to generate.
*  '''do''': this is the normal procedure type. Enter in the field below '''do''' a body for your feature. 
<code>
    do_something
        do
            a := b
        end</code>

*  '''once''': this is the type for a routine that is executed once per execution. As a once routine cannot have arguments, it is disabled when you added one or more arguments. 
<code>
    init
        once
            load
        end</code>

*  '''deferred''': this creates a routine of deferred type. The local and body fields gray out as they serve no use anymore. 
<code>
    do_something
        deferred
        end</code>

*  '''external''': this creates an Eiffel wrap routine around a routine written in another language. Use the body field to enter a string containing the necessary information about the routine using the external syntax. 
<code>
    do_something
        external
            "C | %"location.h%""
        end</code>
