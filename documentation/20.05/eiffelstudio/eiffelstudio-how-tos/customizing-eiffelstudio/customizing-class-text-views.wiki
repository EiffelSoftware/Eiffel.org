It is possible in EiffelStudio to customize some properties of [[Formatted information about compiled classes and features|class text views]]  (other than basic texts) displayed in the editor or class and feature tabs of the context tool. Besides [[Changing texts display|graphical appearance]], you may modify: 
* the order of <code>feature</code> clauses.
* the type of callers and suppliers displayed in the corresponding views.
* the views that are selected by default.
* the <code>note</code> clauses that should not be displayed.
These properties are set in the [[EiffelStudio preferences]]. You can modify them in the [[Preference window overview|preferences window]]. To open this window, select '''Preferences...''' in the '''Tool''' menu. Then select the "Context tool" sub-category of the "Tools" category in the preferences tree. Click then on a preference on the right to modify its value. 
Click on '''save and exit''' to complete the changes.
