The Display window provides a view of the [[EiffelBuild Notation|objects]]  in your system, but unlike the [[Layout constructor|layout constructor]]  and [[Builder window|builder window]] , the objects cannot be manipulated. 

This window may either be shown or hidden (default). To change between these two states, click  [[Image:icon-display-window-color]] on the [[Main toolbar|main toolbar]] , or select '''Show/Hide display window''' from the '''View''' menu.

This view is provided so that you can really see what your project will look like when it has been generated and is running as a stand alone [[EiffelVision Introduction|EiffelVision 2]]  system. 

All properties that have been set on the [[EiffelBuild Notation|objects]]  in your project are set in the [[EiffelVision Introduction|EiffelVision 2]]  control matching its type.
