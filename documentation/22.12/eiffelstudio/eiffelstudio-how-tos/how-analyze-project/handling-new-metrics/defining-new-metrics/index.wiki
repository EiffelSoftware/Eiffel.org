The metric interface provides by default a set of basic metrics. However, user may want to define other metrics, such as linear sums or different ratios, or combining some criteria... This is possible thanks to the '''Metric Definition''' tab of the metric tool. 

New metrics are increasingly added to the list of metrics which is ordered by unit type, and are available for [[Evaluating a measure|calculation]] .
