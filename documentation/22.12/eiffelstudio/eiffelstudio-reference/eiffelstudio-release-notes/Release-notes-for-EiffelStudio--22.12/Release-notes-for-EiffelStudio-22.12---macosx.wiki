= Known issues =
== GUI issues ==
Vision2 UI apps have bad issue on macosx M1/M2 (arm architecture) with XQuartz.
First, be sure to use the default settings, otherwise text fields (and similar) will not work properly for Vision2 application.
```
defaults write org.xquartz.X11 enable_render_extension 1
```

However, in default settings, EiffelStudio has '''back''' blackground for a few widgets (menu, label, ...), when EiffelStudio has the focus, which makes it hard to use. 

EiffelStudio is not the only macosx application having this bad issue with XQuartz, and so far no workaround works well with EiffelStudio. We hope XQuartz will release in the future an update fixing that issue.

===A dirty but acceptable workaround: CSS ===

Using ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css  to use colors that would make EiffelStudio reading in "normal" mode, and in "black background annoyance" mode.

```css
.background { background-color: #cccccc; color: white }
widget, box, text, label { background-color: #cccccc; color: white }
.titlebar { background-color: #ff0000 }
window, menuitem { background-color: #cccccc; color: white }
menuitem:hover { background-color: white; color: #cccccc }
```
