==Graphical environment==

===What's new===
===Improvements===
* Improved dialog that adds a new class to the system: 
** Changed button label to be more explicit about its action
** Removed detachable status when it is not used 
** Removed unnecessary frame boxes
** Simplified code that opens the dialog.
* Improved keyboard navigation in the Info tool.
* Avoided class counter increment in automatically generated class name if class addition is cancelled.
* Set file name of current class to the Save File As dialog.

===Changes===

===Bug fixes===
* Corrected output of the iteration (<code>across</code>) form of the [[ET: Instructions#Loop|loop construct]] in clickable views.
* Fixed feature call on void target when reopening a project with diagram tool that contains cluster legend.
* Fixed a bug in the Info tool: when deleting an EIS entry, selecting "No" did not actually cancel the deletion.

==Compiler==
* Click [[Major changes between ISE Eiffel 6.7 and ISE Eiffel 6.8|here]]  for the compiler release notes.

==Debugger==
===Graphical environment===
* It is now possible to [[Detach application|detach the debugger]] from the application (without killing the application).
* It is now possible to [[Attach application|attach the debugger]] to associated eiffel application launched outside EiffelStudio 
** The application has to be launched in a specific way to wait for the debugger, that is, either
*** by setting <code>ISE_DBG_PORTNUM</code> environment variable to a specific port number, or
*** by calling <code>{RT_DEBUGGER}.rt_workbench_wait_for_debugger</code> (a_port_number) from the program itself
** Then with EiffelStudio, menu <code>Execution->Attach Debuggee</code> and provide the same port number.
** At this point EiffelStudio is able to debug the application

==EiffelBuild==
* Click [[EiffelBuild Version History|here]]  for the EiffelBuild release notes.

==Libraries==

===EiffelBase===
* Minimized interface of <e>ITERATION_CURSOR</e> to simplify crafting cursors for iteration form of a loop on non-container classes, for example, on externally-driven input like files, sockets, etc.
