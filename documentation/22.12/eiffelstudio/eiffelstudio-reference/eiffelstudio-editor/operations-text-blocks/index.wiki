Editing the text of classes sometimes implies highly repetitive tasks, such as commenting or indenting several lines at the same time.

The commands of the editor of EiffelStudio should allow the user to perform these tasks faster and more easily. In addition to text block [[Comment and uncomment lines|commenting]]  and [[Indent and unindent selection|indenting]], EiffelStudio editor makes it possible with one click to [[Embed lines in 'if then...end' or in 'debug...end'|embed]]  several lines of code in "if ... then ... end" or "debug ... end" structures.
