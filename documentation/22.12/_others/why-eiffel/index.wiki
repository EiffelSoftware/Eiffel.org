This book collects arguments for using Eiffel.

Even though we in the Eiffel community know that Eiffel is the most advanced object-oriented software development framework on this planet, that fact may not be so obvious to everyone else. Consequently, we felt that it would be helpful to provide some brief documents that spell out the reasons why the people who have chosen Eiffel have been so successful. 

You may find the information helpful if you are simply curious about Eiffel, if you are actively looking for a better development framework, or if you are busy trying to convince others to try Eiffel.
