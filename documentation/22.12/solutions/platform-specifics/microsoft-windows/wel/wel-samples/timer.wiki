==Compiling==

To compile the example: 
* Launch EiffelStudio. 
* Click '''Add project'''
* Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\wel\timer\''. 
* Choose ''timer.ecf''
* Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file. 
* Click '''OK'''. 

==Running==
After launching the program, a window will be displayed as illustrated above. Clicking on any of the push buttons marked "Start Timer" will start a timer running, and the hatched area immediately above the push button will change its appearance to reflect the interval of the timer. 
==Under the Hood==
A [[ref:libraries/wel/reference/wel_window_chart|WEL_WINDOW]]  supports multiple timers, set by set_timer which takes a unique id for each timer. The <code>on_timer</code> feature is called every time a timer interval is reached with an argument corresponding to the <code>id</code> of the timer. Within <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code>, <code>on_timer</code> has been redefined to update the appearance of the hatched areas. 
This sample contains the following classes: 
* <code>APPLICATION_IDS</code>
* <code>MAIN_WINDOW</code>
* <code>TIMER</code>
