At the top of a development window, the toolbars are displayed by default. The four toolbars are:
# '''Standard buttons''' toolbar
# '''Project''' toolbar
# '''Address''' toolbar
# '''Refactoring''' toolbar

You can choose which toolbars are displayed by right-clicking one of the toolbars, or by following the menu path:

<code lang="text">
View --> Toolbars
</code>

In the figure below, all four toolbars are visible.
