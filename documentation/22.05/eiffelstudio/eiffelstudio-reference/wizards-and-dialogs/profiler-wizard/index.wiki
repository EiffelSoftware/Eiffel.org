The profiler wizard lets you analyze the result of a profiling session. It helps you optimize your system by pointing out the features where your system spends most of its time.

Before using the profiler wizard you must have generated a ''Run-time information record''. A ''Run-time information record'' is generated by a profiler when a program is executed under its control. Most of the time, the ''Run-time information record'' is generated by the profiler integrated into EiffelStudio. See [[Profiling|How to profile a system]]  for more information about how to generate a ''Run-time information record'' with the integrated profiler. 

{{note|You can also use a ''Run-time information record'' generated by an external profiler such as GNU's gprof, Pure Atricia's Quantify, Visual C++ profiler, etc. }}
