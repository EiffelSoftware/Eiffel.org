The archive file for a system contains all the values of measures resulting from evaluating selected metrics. It also contains the definitions of non elementary metrics (the one user has [[Defining new metrics|defined]]) in order to be sure of what is being measured. 

The archive files are entitled to achieve comparisons between systems. And then, user can compare systems to evaluate their own projects.
