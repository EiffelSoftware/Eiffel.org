There are several ways to compile an executable with EiffelStudio.

The most essential compilation modes are: '''melting''', '''freezing''', and '''finalizing'''. To learn more about the compilation semantics in EiffelStudio, see the documentation of [[Melting Ice Technology|Eiffel's compilation technology]]. 

There is a command for each compilation mode in the '''Project''' menu, under the entries '''Compile''', '''Freeze''' and '''Finalize'''. 

The "drop-down" option of the Compile button ([[Image:compile-button]]) on the '''Project''' toolbar also offers these choices as shown in the image below.

If you need the compilation options even handier than this, you can customize the '''Project''' toolbar by adding icons for each of the options:  [[Image:project-melt-icon]] ,  [[Image:project-freeze-icon]] ,  [[Image:project-finalize-icon]] . [[Toolbar customization|Here's how]]. Or you can use the keyboard shortcuts that are shown in the Compile button's drop-down menu.

To help resolve the errors that occur during the Eiffel compilation, use the [[Error wizard|compilation error wizard]]. For errors occurring during the C compilation, check that the installation is not corrupted and refer to your C compiler documentation for more information.
