If you need to use '''ec''' to execute a number of successive operations on a system, you do not need to restart the command each time; instead you may use the '''-loop''' option, which will interactively prompt you for successive operations. 
If you launch '''ec''' with this option, you will get the interactive version's Main Menu:

The revision number in the first line may be different in your case to indicate that you have a more recent delivery. In this menu, and in all subsequent ones, the commands appear in two groups. 
* commands in the first group are specific to each menu
* commands in the second group H (Help) to repeat the list of choices, Y (Yank) to save the output of the last command to a file that you will be prompted to name, and Q (Quit) to quit appear in all menus, and will be complemented in the Item Menus below by the M (Main) command which returns to the main menu.
By typing one of the letters shown in the Main Menu's first group, you can go to one of the Item Menus: [[Class menu|Class]], [[Compile (and run) menu|Compile]], [[Feature menu|Feature]], [[System menu|System]], [[Profile menu|Profile]], and [[Documentation menu|Documentation]]. [[Compile (and run) menu|Compile]] enables you to compile a system and execute the result; the next three enable you to obtain information about your project. [[Profile menu|Profile]]  will enable you to exploit profiling information. Finally, [[Documentation menu|Documentation]] will enable you to generate HTML documentation about your project.
