==Graphical environment==
* New dialog to insert Unicode character (`Ctrl+Alt+Space`), useful for alias operators.
* The auto-completion provides Unicode operators for alias name.

==Compiler==
* It is now possible to use multiple aliases for the same feature.
* Removed `infix` and `prefix` support from the compiler (they were removed already from the language)
* Manifest strings, and string constants can now also use IMMUTABLE_STRING_(8|32) types.
* It is now possible to use non-decimal character codes in manifest strings (for instance: decimal %/8704/, hexadecimal %/0x2200/, octal %/0c21000/ and binary %/0b0010001000000000/ can be used)

==Libraries==
* Removed `infix` and `prefix` from the libraries.
* Added Unicode aliases in classes SET and SUBSET.
* Improved implementation of cgi and proxy handlers in the EiffelWeb framework.
