General behavior
* Double clicking on the grid's header separator will resize the corresponding column. If you hold the <code>SHIFT</code> key at the same time, it will resize according to the displayed cells.
* Right clicking on the header's cell will popup a menu that enable or disable the auto resizing on the selected column. This can be useful to resize automatically the "name" column when inspecting an object value.
* Pressing <code>CTRL</code>+<code>E</code> when the selected line represents a value with potential text representation (STRING, DEBUG_OUPUT ...) will open the [[Object Viewer (also known as Expanded display)|expanded view dialog]]. 

Evaluation tool (also known as Watch tool)
* Dropping an object value on a [[Evaluation tool or Watch tool|Evaluation tool ]] will open the [[New expression dialog|expression definition dialog]] with the object's address filled. This way you can evaluate expression directly on this object. If you hold the <code>CTRL</code> key while dropping, the dropped object will be added as expression in the Evaluation tool as itself.
* You can also drop the object on the notebook tab of the desired Evaluation tool.
