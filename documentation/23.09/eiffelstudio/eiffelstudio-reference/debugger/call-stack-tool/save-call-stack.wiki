It is possible to copy the current call stack to the clipboard ( [[Image:general-copy-icon]] ) or to a text file ( [[Image:general-save-icon]] ). This may be useful to indicate to other members of a team where an error has occurred. After the button is clicked, a dialog is popped up that prompts for a place in which to save the [[Call stack tool: Interface|call stack]] file (if the selected file already exists, it is overwritten).
