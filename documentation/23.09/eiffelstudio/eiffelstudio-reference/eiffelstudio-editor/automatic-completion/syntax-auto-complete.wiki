Syntax auto-complete in EiffelStudio editor is twofold :

*  The editor can close brackets ("(", "{" and "[") and quotes(""", "'" and "`") automatically. This feature is disabled by default. It can be activated in the editor preferences.

*  The editor can complete syntactic structures or part of them. The auto-complete is triggered when "Enter" or "Space" keys are pressed after a reserved word included in the following list:
{| align="center"
|- 
| class
| ensure
| invariant
| require else
|- 
| check
| ensure then
| is
| rescue
|- 
| create
| export
| local
| select
|- 
| creation
| external
| loop
| then
|- 
| debug
| feature
| obsolete
| undefine
|- 
| deferred
| from
| once
| until
|- 
| do
| if
| precursor
| variant
|- 
| else
| indexing
| redefine
| when
|- 
| elseif
| inherit
| rename
|- 
| end
| inspect
| require
|}
