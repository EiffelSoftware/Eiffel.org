==Compiling==

To compile the example:   
# Launch EiffelStudio.
# Click '''Add project'''
# Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\dotnet\winforms\control_reference\tree_view_ctl\''
# Choose ''tree_view_ctl.ecf''
# Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file.
# Click '''Open'''.


==Running==

After launching the application, you will see a window displayed with a similar appearance to the one above. On the left of the form you have the <span><eiffel>TREE_VIEW</eiffel></span> control, and on the right you have some controls to configure the <span><eiffel>TREE_VIEW</eiffel></span>. 



==Under the Hood==

The application shows how to use a <span><eiffel>TREE_VIEW</eiffel></span> and what are all its different configurations. 

This sample uses the following classes:
*  <span><eiffel>TREE_VIEW</eiffel></span> 
*  <span><eiffel>GROUP_BOX</eiffel></span> 
*  <span><eiffel>CHECK_BOX</eiffel></span> 
*  <span><eiffel>COMBO_BOX</eiffel></span> 
*  <span><eiffel>LABEL</eiffel></span> 

==Notes==

This sample is translated from the example located in the QuickStart\winforms\samples\ControlReference\TreeView subdirectory of the .NET Framework SDK samples directory of Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.
