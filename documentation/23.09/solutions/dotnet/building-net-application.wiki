Eiffel for .NET has some specific functionality meant to leverage necessary aspects of the .NET Framework. 

For that reason, the [[EiffelStudio: Project settings window|project settings]]  for Eiffel for .NET introduces new options. These options include: 
* Specifying whether the generated assembly should be an EXE or a DLL. 
* Choosing between generating verifiable or non verifiable IL code. Non verifiable IL code executes faster but requires high trust settings. 

The Eiffel for .NET compiler generates a single assembly whose name is the name of the system as given in the [[System Options|system options of the project settings]] .
