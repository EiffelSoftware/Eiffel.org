The data structures cluster of EiffelBase includes classes that cover a wide range of data structures classes for you to reuse in your systems. The cluster is divided into a number of subclusters. Each subcluster contains one or more '''deferred''' classes, which provide the general high-level abstractions; other classes in the cluster inherit from the deferred ones. 

The highest-level class is [[ref:libraries/base/reference/container_chart| CONTAINER]] , with the following heirs: 
*  [[ref:libraries/base/reference/collection_chart|COLLECTION]] , which describes containers through their access properties (defining how to access a container's items, forexample through an index or according to a last-in, first-out policy). 
*  [[ref:libraries/base/reference/traversable_chart|TRAVERSABLE]] , which considers their traversal properties, such as sequential or hierarchical. 
*  [[ref:libraries/base/reference/box_chart|BOX]] , which describes their storage properties, such as being bounded or unbounded.
