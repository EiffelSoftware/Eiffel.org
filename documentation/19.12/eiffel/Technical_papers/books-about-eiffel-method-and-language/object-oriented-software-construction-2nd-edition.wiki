This Jolt Award winner takes the reader through the clear, logical, and comprehensive formation of a method for object-oriented software development ... the Eiffel method. During this journey, the author evolves a notation capable of expressing the products of each phase of development, from analysis through implementation. This notation is the Eiffel programming language.


==Praise for '''''Object-Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition'''''==

Roger Smith, on the Dr. Dobbs Journal website, writes:

:"In my unbiased opinion [...] it is destined to become the comprehensive and definitive reference for most methodological and technical questions raised by object technology. Its width and breadth of scope is impressive, from object-oriented techniques like Design by Contract and inheritance, to methodology issues like patterns and class design, to advanced issues like concurrency and persistence."


In ''Unix Review'', Stan Kelly-Bootle calls this book "The ultimate O-O guide."


Ian Graham, in ''Journal of Object-Oriented Programming'' calls it "Epoch-making".
