The '''callers''' view [[Image:feature-callers-icon]] displays all the features which use the current feature in any way. 


So the callers view includes features which actually call the current feature. 

Additionally, callers also includes, where appropriate, those features that assign to the current feature (the feature's assigners [[Image:feature-assigners-icon]]), those features that create the current feature (the feature's creators [[Image:feature-creators-icon]]), and those features that use the current feature as an argument to other features. So, for example, assigners and creators could show up only in a list of callers for a feature that is an attribute.


In the EiffelStudio preferences it is possible to choose whether callers of the feature's descendant versions should be displayed too (they are by default).
