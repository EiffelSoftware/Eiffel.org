[[Image:information tool change analysis]]

The information tool can track changes in an Eiffel system or external resources side, and potentially affected items on either side are listed.

== Major Features ==
* '''Affected target:''' List of elements of the Eiffel system that would be affected by a change in external resources.
* '''Affected source:''' List of external resources that might be affected by changes in the Eiffel system.
* '''Change acknowledgement:''' Acknowledgement of the changes which will be ignored with no further actions.

== Typical Work Flows ==

=== Affected external resources caused by a change in the Eiffel system ===
# Open a class, add an Information entry with an external resource in the class.
# Start working on that class, save it at as you normally do on regular basis.
# Open the information tool, go to Affected source item in the left tree.
# Check the list of external resources that might be affected by last changes.
# Acknowledge the changes once you have updated the external resource accordingly (possibly no change is required in the case of simple system changes).

=== Affected items in the Eiffel system caused by an external resource change ===
# Open a class, add an Information entry with an external resource in the class.
# Start working on that external resource, save it at as you normally do on regular basis.
# Open the information tool, go to Affected target in the left tree.
# Check the list of classes that might be affected by last changes of the external resource. (You may need to click on the "sweep the system now." button to get a full list if auto-sweeping is not enabled.)
# Acknowledge the changes once you have updated the Eiffel system accordingly (possibly no change is required in the case of a simple edit in the external resource).

== Current limitations ==
The tracking of external resource changes is limited to external resources that are local files. If an external resource is a URL, it will not detect any potential changes done at that URL.
