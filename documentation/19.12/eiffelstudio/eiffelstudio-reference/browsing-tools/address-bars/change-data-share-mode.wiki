Located in the '''View''' menu, named either '''Link context tool''' or '''Unlink context tool''', this command allows you to switch between the two possible [[Address bars|addressing modes]]. Toggling of Linked/Unlinked mode also can be accomplished through a button on the main toolbar ([[Image:context-link-icon]]). By default, this button is not visible, but can be added to the toolbar through [[Toolbar customization|toolbar customization]].

{{note|This command only applies to the development window where it is invoked, and this setting is not automatically saved when exiting EiffelStudio. }}
