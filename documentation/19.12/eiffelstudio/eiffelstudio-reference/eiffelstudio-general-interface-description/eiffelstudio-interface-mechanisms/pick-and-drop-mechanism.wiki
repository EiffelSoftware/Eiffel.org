Pick-and-drop is one of Eiffel Software's exclusive technologies and is provided by [[EiffelVision Introduction|EiffelVision]]. In EiffelStudio it allows you to send data easily from a component of the interface to another. 

You can pick every reference to a '''development object''' (like a class, a feature or an execution object) with a single click on the '''right''' mouse button. Then as you start moving the mouse around - not pressing any of its buttons - a pebble tracks the cursor position, and a line continuously connects the pebble to the object's original position. The pebble's shape indicates the type of the development object that you picked (oval disk for a class, cross for a feature, folder for a cluster...).

You may terminate this situation in either of two ways:
* If the pebble you are dragging is not crossed, you can right-click again to confirm the pick-and-drop and so effectively send the dragged development object to the targeted component. For a class, a droppable pebble looks like this:  [[Image:context-class-cursor]]  
Right-clicking when the pebble is crossed will only stop the pick-and-drop because the component you are hovering with the mouse does not accept your development object. For a class, a not droppable pebble looks like this:  [[Image:context-disabled-class-cursor]]  

* If, for any reason, you change your mind, you can cancel the pick-and-drop by left-clicking anywhere or by pressing the Escape key.
