# Choose ''mdi.ecf''
# Choose the location where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the configuration file.

==Running==

After launching the application, you will see a window displayed with a similar appearance to the one above. The main window contains a menu with three entries (File, Format and Window). This menu can merge with its child windows (Document). 

In the "File" entry, you can add a child window (Document),display the active child window, and exit the program. 

You can change the format of the text displayed in the child windows using the entry "Format" in the menu. 

You can choose the organization (cascade, title horizontal or title vertical) of the child windows using the entry "Window" in the menu.
