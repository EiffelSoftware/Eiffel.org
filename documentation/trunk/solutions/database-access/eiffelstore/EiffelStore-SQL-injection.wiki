= Introduction =
In this article we will explain you how to use EiffelStore API to avoid SQL injections.

= What is an SQL injection? =
An SQL injection attack is a coding technique that inserts, or "injects", an SQL query via the input data, passing unsafe input from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection can enable the attacker to read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), or become administrator of the database server.  To learn more about SQL injection, read the following articles.

= Template Query =
A template query is a string containing the fixed parts of the query and placeholders for the variable parts, and you can later substitute in values into those placeholders. (Bind variables to the query.). A template query could be static or dynamic

{{Note|the way you bind variables to the query is quite important and it will define if your query is safe and avoid a SQL Injection attack.}}
