==Network communication solutions==

Many Eiffel applications take advantage of networking. The Eiffel solutions to support networking include the EiffelNet, ZeroMQ and http_client libraries.

===Choosing the right libraries===
The libraries serve different, and complementary, purposes:

*EiffelNet enables Eiffel systems to use many Internet concepts and protocols: sockets, network address, IPV4, IPV6 and others.

*ZeroMQ supports direct messaging.

*http_client is a web client used to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, ...) and process the associated responses.

===Using the libraries===

Here is how to take advantage of one or more of the above libraries in your Eiffel system:



* '''EiffelNet''':
: manipulation of sockets, network addresses, IPv4, IPv6. But also basic limited implementation for a few protocols. <code lang="shell">$ISE_LIBRARY/library/net/net.ecf</code>

* '''ZeroMQ''': 
: wrapping for the [http://zeromq.org/ ZeroMQ] Distributed Messaging . [https://svn.eiffel.com/eiffelstudio/trunk/Src/library/zeromq]

* '''http_client''':
: simple web client to send http (GET, POST, ...) request and receive associated response. <code lang="shell">$ISE_LIBRARY/contrib/library/network/http_client/http_client.ecf</code>
