== Common ancestor type ==

A *common ancestor type* is a type computed for a list of types using the following algorithm:

1. Temporary ignore whether any types are detachable or separate.
2. Add a type `NONE` to the list of types (this makes sure the list is never empty).
3. If there is a type in the list to which all other types conform, remember it as T.
4. Otherwise, use `ANY` for T.
5. If there is a detachable or separate type in the list, use the corresponding detachable and/or separate version of type T.
