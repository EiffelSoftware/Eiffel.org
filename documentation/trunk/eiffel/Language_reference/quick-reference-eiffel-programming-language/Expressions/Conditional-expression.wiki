= Conditional expression =

[[Eiffel%20Programming%20Language%20Syntax#Conditionals|Conditional expressions]] compute a value using different expressions depending on one or more conditions. If all expressions have the same type, the conditional expression as a whole has this type as well:

<e>
   if time < noon then
      "Good morning"
   elseif time < evening then
      "Good afternoon"
   else
      "Good evening"
   end
</e>

has type `STRING`.

If the types of the expressions are different, the [[Types#Common ancestor types|common ancestor type]] is used as a type of the whole expression.

<e>
   if time < noon then
      "Good morning"
   else
      Void
   end
</e>

has type `detachable STRING`.
