{{UnderConstruction}}

==Graphical environment==
===Improvements ===
* The debugger has now a better support for class routine. For expression evaluation in the watch tool, but also by showing, in the call stack tool, a class icon for the non-object call.
* The completion popup dialog shows now the associated target class (if any) before the list of choices.
* For convenience, it is possible to recompile from scratch the current project from the EiffelStudio `Project>Compile from scratch` menu.
* The class tool can now display the `description` indexing note of classes within the tool using a toggle button to show/hide this information.
*There is a new experimental functionality to export and import editor tabs to and from text. It can be useful to restore open tabs from another machine (available in the hidden `menu>Service>Import/Export tabs...` , Ctrl+Alt+D).
* After a refactoring operation, the editor will focus back on the related feature.

===User changes===

==Compiler==
* The compiler now supports conditions based on current void safety compilation mode (in addition to the platform, concurrency, version, ...).
* When assertion tag is not specified, the expression is used for the tag and makes diagnostics of such assertion violations more efficient.
* Fixed various issues related to the remote parent target in .ecf file. (i.e the possibility to extend a target from another .ecf file)
