{{UnderConstruction}}

==Graphical environment==
===Improvements ===
* The debugger has now a better support for class routine. For expression evaluation in the watch tool, but also by showing, in the call stack tool, a class icon for the non-object call.
* The completion popup dialog shows now the associated target class (if any) before the list of choices.
* The class tool can now display the `description` indexing note of classes within the tool using a toggle button to show/hide this information.
* Improved the diagram tool by scaling client-supplier lines with a minimum width of 3 pixels and a proportional increase of nested lines width and arrow size to the overall line width. And also use anti-aliasing when drawing (can be disabled via preferences).
* After a refactoring operation, the editor will focus back on the related feature.
* For convenience, it is possible to recompile from scratch the current project from the EiffelStudio `Project>Compile from scratch` menu.
*There is a new experimental functionality to export and import editor tabs to and from a text. It can be useful to restore open tabs from another machine (available in the hidden `menu>Service>Import/Export tabs...` , Ctrl+Alt+D).

===User changes===

==Compiler==
* The compiler now supports conditions based on current void safety compilation mode (in addition to the platform, concurrency, version, ...).
* When assertion tag is not specified, the expression is used for the tag and makes diagnostics of such assertion violations more efficient.
* Fixed various issues related to the remote parent target in .ecf file. (i.e the possibility to extend a target from another .ecf file)
* Added support for `-config_option concurrency:value` and `-config_option void_safety:value` command-line options to override concurrency and void safety settings when compiling a project.
* Now the exception trace in final mode or workbench uses the same assertion indexes, wether assertions are kept or not during finalization.

==Libraries==
* OpenSSL binding: Updated the OpenSSL wrapper with asymmetric algorithms (RSA). Updated to OpenSSL 1.1.1a .
* JWT (JSON Web Token): made it possible to register simply new JWT algorithm. Added the `jwt_openssl_extension` library, that provides RSA based JWT signing algorithm (implemented with the OpenSSL binding).
* JSON: Improved the memory and speed performance of the JSON Parser. Added convenient function `JSON_VALUE.chained_item (a_key): JSON_VALUE` to be able to do chained calls like `json @ "person" @ "address" @ "city" ` and to get an associated JSON value (if any) or JSON_NULL.
* ROC CMS: Improved security by providing protection against XSS attack.
* EiffelWeb: adopted nanoseconds timeout precision, especially for standalone connector settings (use ns, us, ms, s suffix when defining the timeout in the .ini file).
