[[Property:title|Release notes for EiffelStudio 19.05]]
[[Property:link_title|19.05]]
==Graphical environment==
* You can now easily add unicode symbol (mostly for mathematical operators) using the feature completion dialog. Either type the first 2 letters of the wanted operator, or use `Ctrl+space` to switch to the corresponding panel. (See $ISE_EIFFEL/eifinit/unicode_symbols.cfg ).
* The IDE has now a basic support for HiDPI resolution.

==Compiler==
* 

==Libraries==
* A few improvements when dealing with file names, and temporary files. The class `FILE_NAME` is now marked as obsolete. It is recommanded to use class `PATH` instead to build file name (support unicode). And for temporary files, use `make_open_temporary` and `make_open_temporary_with_prefix` from class `FILE`. A new function `null_path` was also added to`FILE` to ease portability among platforms.
* The `URI`class supports now IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications).

==Tools==
* 

==Examples==
