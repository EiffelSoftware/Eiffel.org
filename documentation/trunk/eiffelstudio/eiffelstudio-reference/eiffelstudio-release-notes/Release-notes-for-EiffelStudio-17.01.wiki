{{UnderConstruction|This page is under construction.}}

==Graphical environment==
===What's new===
* Added new Import settings dialog. It is shown when a new version of EiffelStudio is launched for the first time, and available at any time from menu `Tools > Import Settings`.
* Added `code templates` functionality. Using code completion, it is possible to insert predefined code template as-is or modify them as necessary. User can as well create his own templates (custom templates). To learn more click [https://www.eiffel.org/doc/eiffelstudio/Code%20Templates here].

===Improvements===
* Changed how the debugger object tools displays the `Result` value, now it does not have any parent row.
* Added `ISE_COMPILE_ALL_FLAGS` environment variable support to the `compile_all` tool  (its value is added to compile_all command line arguments). 
* Modified `compile_all` tool, to exclude ecf redirection file from its scope.


===Bug fixes===
* 

==Compiler==
* Added a notion of capabilities that allows for specifying what settings a particular library is capable of. At the moment the settings include cat-call detection, concurrency and void safety. A project or a library with a specific setting cannot rely on a library with insufficient capabilities.
* Configuration option "Are types attached by default?" defaults to True when reading non-void-safe projects so that if the project is changed to be void-safe, the recommended default for attachment status of class types without marks is used.
* Removed a possibility to set void safety level for a specific class or cluster, it can be done only for a whole library or project.

==Libraries==
===General===
* Added new JSON serialization solution under `contrib/library/text/parser/json/library/serialization`.

===EiffelNet===
* Added receive and send timeout.
* Added C functions to use socket functions without raising exception on I/O networking error.

===EiffelWeb===
* Changed the standalone connector implementation to avoid raising exception for any networking error (it brings better debugger experience).
* Added new websocket standalone connector to be able to build within the same processor a web service and a websocket service.
* Change the networking programing in EiffelWeb components, to benefit from recent improvements on EiffelNet. 
* Added finer control on standalone connector. It is now possible to fine tune the standalone connector (concurrent settings, timeout values, ...)
