{{UnderConstruction|This page is under construction.}}

==Graphical environment==
===What's new===
* New Import settings dialog. It is shown when a new version of EiffelStudio is launched for the first time, and available at any time from menu `Tools > Import Settings`.

===Improvements===
* The debugger Object tools now displays the `Result` value without any parent row.
* Compile_all: added `ISE_COMPILE_ALL_FLAGS` environment variable support (its content is added to compile_all command line arguments). Exclude ecf redirection file from compile_all scope.


===Bug fixes===
* 

==Compiler==
* 

==Libraries==
===General===
* New JSON serialization solution under `contrib/library/text/parser/json/library/serialization`.

===EiffelNet===
* Added receive and send timeout.
* Added C functions to use socket functions without raising exception on I/O networking error.

===EiffelWeb===
* The standalone connector does not raise anymore on networking exception (better debugger experience).
* New websocket standalone connector to be able to build within the same processor a web service and a websocket service.
* The socket usage in EiffelWeb benefits from recent improvement on EiffelNet. In addition it is not possible to fine tune the standalone connector (concurrent settings, timeout values, ...)
