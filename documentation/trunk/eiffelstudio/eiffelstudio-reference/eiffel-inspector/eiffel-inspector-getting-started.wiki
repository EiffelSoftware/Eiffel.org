== A Simple Analysis ==

Press the '''Analyze System''' button. If needed, the system will be compiled now. A successful compilation is required for the Eiffel Inspector to run. After a successful compilation the analysis will start and will check all classes of your system. The status bar shows the progress by displaying the class currently being analyzed. As soon as the analysis is complete, results will show up in the panel as a list of ''rule violations''.
