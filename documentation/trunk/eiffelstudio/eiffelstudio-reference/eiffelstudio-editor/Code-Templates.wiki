EiffelStudio editor includes a new feature designed to help write Eiffel code. Code template completion is it.

Code templates in Eiffel are described in Eiffel itself, there are some constraints to define templates that we will cover below. At the moment Code templates can only be used as part of an existing feature. Some templates will be available as global/target-less templates, it means there is not target context, so you can include a useful template inside your current feature. In other cases we will have templates that will be only available to certain context, for example if you have an ARRAY [INTEGER], then you will be able to see templates applicable to it, if any.
